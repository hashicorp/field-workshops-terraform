# Terraform Cloud on Azure workshop
## Getting started
This is a half-day workshop that introduces Terraform Cloud using an Azure-based application for the Instruqt labs. If you're brand new to Terraform you should try the Introduction to Terraform Community Edition on Azure Instruqt track before this one.

The instructions on how to conduct a workshop are in the standard [instructor's guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/field-workshops-terraform/blob/main/instructor-guides/all_terraform_cloud_INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md).

## Navigation

Here are some helpful keyboard shortcuts for the instructor:

- Use your keyboard ⬅ ➡ to navigate back and forth
- Use `P` to toggle presenter view and notes
- Use `C` to detach an external window for presentation

**Note** - We disabled navigating using mouse gestures and scrolling. Most instructors at HashiCorp use Macbooks, and with Apple Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad the swipe gesture can inadvertedly move the slides backwards or fowards, loosing control of the presentation.

## Customization

This slide deck is written entirely in Markdown language, which means you can make edits by submitting a pull request to add your changes to the main branch. To make edits to the slide deck, fork this repository, edit the Markdown file(s), and submit a pull request with your changes. When editing, you can test a local copy of the slide deck with this Python one-liner:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

# Terraform Adoption Journey: Individual

A Terraform deployment usually starts with an individual practitioner and a prescriptive workflow

1. Write a Terraform configuration file or "infrastructure-as-code"
     
2. Iterate to make the plan correct, then apply the plan

3. As needs change, modify the configuration file and repeat the plan-and-apply process

![Adoption Journey - Individual](images/adoption_journey_individual.svg)

???
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Individual

- A HashiCorp Terraform deployment usually starts with an individual practitioner who writes a Terraform configuration file ("infrastructure as code").
  
- The individual practitioner iterates to make the plan correct, then applies the plan. 

- As needs change, they modify the the configuration file and repeat the plan-and-apply process.

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE**: Highlight potential vulnerabilities:

1. The individual practitioner is responsible for the Terraform State 

2. The individual practitioner also needs to manage and secure credentials to the target environment

3. The individual practitioner manages the properties of the deployment

4. It is not ideal for collaboration 

---
name: terraform-adoption-journey-teams
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Teams (1/2)

With teams, the process is fundamentally the same, but there should be a version control system to provide a single source of truth

1. With a version control system, there is only one change at a time
   
2. Teams apply changes to the infrastructure from that single source of truth

![Adoption Journey - Singular Team](images/adoption_journey_groups.svg)

???
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Teams (1/2)

- If there's a team collaborating to use Terraform, rather than just one individual, the process is basically the same.

- They should use some sort of version-control to provide a single source of truth.

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE**: Highlight the following:

1. Teams are responsible for the Terraform State. Don't put it in VCS.

2. Teams need coordinate and secure credentials to the target environment

3. VCS reduces collisions by centralizing the desired properties of the deployment as written in the IaC collection.

---
name: terraform-adoption-journey-multiple-teams
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Teams (2/2)

With several teams involved, it is best to decompose the infrastructure hierarchically

1. Each team becomes responsible for a functional part of the infrastructure
   
2. The Terraform configuration components decompose into separate workspaces
   
3. Each workspace should have role-based access control to differentiate producers and consumers

![Adoption Journey - Teams](images/adoption_journey_multiple_groups.svg)

???
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Teams (2/2)

- But as we go to many teams this starts to become impractical. There's too much coordination required and the configuration becomes overly complex.

- Instead, what we'd like to do is hierarchically decompose our infrastructure. We might say we have one team that focuses on the underlying network typology and cloud configuration.

- For instance, we might have a series of middleware—a middleware tier. This might look at different things:
  
  - We might have a central solution for logging,
  - We might have a central monitoring solution,
  - Maybe we have security appliances that we share between applications.

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE**: Highlight the following:

1. You may introduce the concept of producers and consumers.

2. How do we organize a common pattern around publishers and consumers?

---
name: terraform-adoption-journey-organization
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Organization

Most organizations have a few publishers and many consumers working against a central registry

1. A central registry consists of pre-approved templates with configurable properties

2. Catalogue items are governed by policies that reflect technical, security and compliance guidelines

3. Self-service infrastructure must fall within the "sandbox" model 

![](images/adoption_journey_organization.svg)

???
# Terraform Adoption Journey: Organization

- In some organizations, there are many users, most of whom are not trained on Terraform, and it wouldn't be practical to train them all. 

- One common pattern is to have a few producers (publishers) and a large number of consumers all working against a central registry. 

- Organizations can also use HashiCorp Sentinel to define and maintain a **sandbox**, which polices what consumers can and cannot do ("Policy-as-Code").

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE**: What is that sandbox model?

1. A sandbox is a metaphor to define a safe deployment boundary. Instead of redifining deployment standards for every request, a sandox says: "**You're allowed to do any type of infrastructure change you want inside of a sandbox**."
   
2. Policies define the sandbox. Deployments that comply with policies are on the inside, vs. things that violate the policies are on the outside and are rejected.

3. For instance, we don't want teams to open up the firewall and allow all traffic to come in, or set their S3 bucket to the universe and expose data.

# Chapter 1 review

1. The adoption journey of infrastructure-as-code with Terraform includes phases of maturity for individuals, groups, and organizations

2. Terraform Cloud is a SOC2-compliant cloud service to manage the lifecycle of infrastructure deployments

???
# Chapter 1 review

1. The adoption patterns we see, both among our large-scale users as well as individual contributors, involve multiple adaptive stages. The central idea remains uniform in that automation should be standardized as shared practice, and that governance guidelines are needed to support emerging requirements.

2. Terraform Cloud is not the same as Terraform Community Edition. Terraform Cloud is a cloud service, and Terraform Community Edition is the technology used to provision infrastructure. We use Terraform Cloud to manage the lifecyle of infrastructure deployemnts using Terraform [Community].

# The Core of Infrastructure as Code

With HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), infrastructure and services from any provider can be provisioned in a codified, secure, and automated fashion.
* HCL is human-readable and machine-executable
* Declarative, Turing-complete language
* Engineered for automation and collaboration 

![Sample Code](images/code_example.svg)

???
# The Core of Infrastructure as Code
- At the core of Infrastructure as Code is the industry de facto technology, Terraform.

- Instead of building things as a series of manual steps, or error-prone shell scripts that may or may not be tested and up to date, you express all your infrastructure build steps in this simple Domain Specific Language, or terraform. 

- The official name for the Terraform config syntax is HashiCorp Config Language, or HCL. This language is easy for beginners and powerful for experts. Think of it as the DNA of your infrastructure.

- This code snippet is here in case you have any brand new, or non-technical people who have never seen a terraform resource before.

name: core-terraform-workflow
class: col-3, header-adjust, header-adjust-minimal-list
# The Core Terraform Workflow

### Write
* Author infrastructure as code
* You write Terraform configuration just like you write code
* It parallels working on application code as an individual

### Plan
* Preview changes before applying
* When the feedback loop of the Write step has yielded a change that looks good, commit your work and review the final plan

### Apply
* Provision reproducible infrastructure
* Instruct Terraform to provision real infrastructure
???
# The Core Terraform Workflow

- There are three stages on the Core Terraform Workflow: Write, Plan and Apply
  
- This parallels the first stage on the Terraform Adoption Journey, where 
  
  - individuals work through the details of a deployment on their own
  - individuals are responsible for the overall management of their deployment properties
  - individuals or robots trigger manual runs of deployments

- This workflow is apt for most small projects where a single person or group can manage the overall context in a smallish scale

class: col-3, header-adjust, header-adjust-minimal-list
# The Core Terraform Workflow and Terraform Cloud

### Write
* Author infrastructure as code and maintain in VCS
* Team members work on authoring config until it is ready to propose changes via a pull request
* Terraform Cloud secures state, input variables, and authorized access
  
<br>

### Plan
* Automated, speculative plans review changes before applying so team members can quickly analyze the full plan details
* Terraform Cloud estimates monthly costs of deployment
* Terraform Cloud evaluates policies against the plan to determine compliance with policy-as-code logic

### Apply
* Team members trigger __apply__ directives via CLI, API or VCS change control
* Authorized Terraform Cloud users can approve or reject deployments 
* Terraform Cloud can integrate third-party tools and services to manage cost, security, and compliance; Or, to enhance your workflow with custom logic
???
# The Core Terraform Workflow and Terraform Cloud

- There are still only three stages on the Core Terraform Workflow, but there are significant improvements in the approach to manage deployments. For instance:

  - With Terrafom Cloud, the immediate change is the intentional positioning for collaboration

  - Teams tend to focus on the centralization of IaC in VCS for formal contribution

  - Teams grant authorized platform capabilities to administrators, IaC producers and IaC consumers

  - Teams make an emphasis on integrating third-party tooling for testing, validation and ongoing maintenance

![:scale 40%](images/adoption_journey_multiple_groups.svg)
---
name: tfc-workspaces
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Projects and Workspaces

- Terraform Cloud organizes infrastructure collections with projects and workspaces that align to teams

- A project is a logical grouping of Terraform Cloud workspaces 

- Workspaces contain everything Terraform needs to manage a given collection of infrastructure, and separate workspaces function like completely separate working entities

![Browser](images/projects-and-workspaces.svg)
???
# Projects and Workspaces

- As teams move through the adoption cycle, they need structure to organize their IaC materials 

- Project are important for coordinating related content with context. For example:
  
  - Grouping deployment types by application
  - Grouping deployment types by Cloud provider
  - Grouping deployment types by department
  - Grouping deployment types by team

- Workspaces fit into Projects to execute on the actual deployments. Each workspace follows logic for execution and access rules, policies, resources, integrations, etc. are inherent from the project or Terraform Cloud organization.
---
name: tfc-state
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Deployment State

- Terraform Cloud retains historical state versions, available for analysis of infrastructure changes over time

- Authorized users can download and manipulate state to manually import, taint, move, or rename existing resources to match a drift in configuration

- Authorized users can roll back to a previous state version with the UI

- Terraform Cloud uses state to measure drift with automated Health Assessments

![Browser](images/workspace-state.svg)
???
# Deployment State
- State is important because it provides an inventory of the IaC deployment. When changes are needed, Terraform knows exactly what to change and the dependencies associated.

- Every IaC deployment has a corresponding state, and historic versions are maintained for the lifecycle of a deployment.
  
- Authorized users have full control of state to make updates, manage drift, import new entries, etc.

- All state information is fully encrypted at rest, where each object is encrypted with a unique encryption key.
---
name: tfc-variables
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Deployment Variables

- Terraform Cloud supports a global scope with **variable sets**. These can be exposed globaly or to select workspaces

- Terraform Cloud workspaces use local variables - may override variable sets

- Variable subsets include
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Environment variables to store provider credentials or Terraform's default behaviours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terraform variables for dynamic input parameters used to configure properties in a deployment</td>
  </tr>
</table>

![Terraform Cloud Variables](images/deployment_variables.svg)

???
# Deployment Variables
- Variable Sets are meaningful when an organization organizes deployments in logical groupings. Instead of managing individual deployments and their properties, administrators make assignments a global set of variables, and focus on the lifecyle of those variables.
  
- Consider the followign scenarios. With the HCL language, Terraform works in a dynamic form to support variables in a global or local scope. How would you apply these variables?

  - Things that we know prior to the deployment. For instance, Cloud region, how many instances of a VM, what firewall rules, etc. **If** these are unique for each deployment, then workspace variables. Otherwise, **if** these are common across a group, use variable sets.

  - Things that we do not know or control, but which exist in private. For example, the access credentials to a Cloud account - which are derived dynamically from a third-party. **If** these are shared across a group, use variable sets.
  
  - Things that are configured during the deployment. Consider, the internal ID or a Cloud VPC, the ARN of a security group, the URL or a storage bucket. These can be more applicable to workspace variables.

- Users must belong to a team with appropriate grant permissions to perform actions in Terraform Cloud

- The permissions model splits into organization-level and workspace-level permissions

- Organization owners can grant teams permissions to manage policies, projects and workspaces, VCS settings, private registry providers and modules, and policy overrides across an organization

![Terraform Cloud Permissions Model](images/permissions_model.svg)
???
# Permissions Model
- The permissions model splits into into organization-level and workspace-level permissions. This is the best combination to align administrators, producers and consumers to manage, create and consume resources via Terraform Cloud.

- The organization-level permissions use an `Implicit-Deny` - which means Terraform Cloud administration is subject to assignment. In this model, teams fucntion based on their permissions and membership.

- The workspace-level permissions have `Implied Permissions` - where Terraform Cloud provides most common functions. Under this model permissions imply other permissions; for example, permission to queue plans also grants permission to read runs.

- Q: What complements the permissions model? A: The alignment of Terraform Cloud teams with external teams via single-sign-on (SSO).

# Team collaboration
There are three main elements to the Terraform collaboration experience:
- **Central registry**: Share reusable Terraform modules across teams
- **Centralized plans and applies**: Safely run Terraform plans and applies in one location where collaborators can review and make decisions together
- **State management**: Store, secure, lock, and version Terraform state files

![Terraform Cloud Permissions Model](images/collaboration_experience.svg)

???
# Team collaboration
- The structure of the Möbius strip visual reflects a familiar way to describe a lifecycle process. There are many examples of that idea, and our intent is to explain where Terraform Cloud provides value. 

- These concepts likely overlap with existing frameworks and that is why integration resonates with sophisticated environments.

- The key values on using these elements are aligned as follows:
  
|     | Element          |     | Benefit                                                 |
| --- | :--------------- | --- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| -   | Central registry |     | Faster devevelopment with composed, re-usable resources |
| -   | Execution engine |     | Deploy securely, at scale, with standard workflows      |
| -   | State management |     | Break glass, secure service to protect sensitive data   |

# Chapter 2 review

1. Terraform Cloud permissions model splits into organization and workspace levels

2. Resource administration in Terraform Cloud defaults to an implicit deny-all model, and teams require global, project or workspace assignments

???
# Chapter 2 review

1. When teams are intent in formalizing their approach to automated infrastructure deployment with Terraform, there need to be fundamental principals to support a responsible use of Terraform Cloud. The permissions model is a core principle to support governance and responsible use of IaC automation. Without a permissions model, teams operated based on different opinions without self-supervision.

2. When teams have different responsibilities, the platform instrumentation should allow for effective changes at a group level to support roles, not individual identities. Having an implicit `deny-all` for the Terraform Cloud organization, and `implied permissions` for teams and workspaces accelerates the effective purpose of IaC automation.

# VCS Connections
- Access a list of repositories and link to your private module registry, policy sets and workspaces in Terraform Cloud

- Terraform Cloud downloads the contents of a repository based on workflow triggers   

- Terraform Cloud supports Azure DevOps, BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab

![VCS Workflow Overview](images/vcs_workflow_overview.svg)

???
# VCS Connections
- Terraform Cloud uses VCS connection to link directly to assets in repos

- VCS connections are configured once and used for three specific types of assets:
  
  1. Terraform Modules to list in the private Terraform Cloud Registry
   
  2. Policy collections to align with Policy Sets
   
  3. Terraform deployments in a 1:1 relationship with Workspaces

- It is important to remember that Terraform Cloud Worspaces can use up to three types of workflows to trigger a run: 1- `CLI`, 2- `VCS` and 3- `API`. Using VCS satisfies one of these workflow patterns.

---
name: tfc-vcs-connection
class: col-2, minimal-list
# VCS Workflow
- Workspaces register webhooks with your VCS provider, and Terraform Cloud gets notified of new commits to a branch
  
- With VCS integration, Terraform Cloud can automatically initiate a run on a dedicated Terraform Cloud worker

- Terraform Cloud makes code review easier by automatically predicting how pull requests affect infrastructure with speculative plans

![VCS Connection Overview](images/vcs_connection_overview.svg)

???
# VCS Workflow
- A VCS connection is established at the administrative level for the VCS provider and Terraform Cloud.

- From the illustration:
  
  1. A new commit to a repository creates a Webhook notification.
  
  2. Notifications are triggered by pull requests and merges.
   
  3. The Webhook notifies the associated Terraform Cloud workspace.

  4. Terraform Cloud securely retrieves the IaC collection to a secure location in Terraform Cloud. The location is not exposed outside of Terraform Cloud.
   
  5. With a pull request, Terraform Cloud runs a speculative plan. 
   
  6. The results are processed back to the VCS pull request for further processing.

  7. With a successful plan, an other validing tests, the pull request is merged.

  8. With an authorized VCS merge, Terraform Cloud initiates a new run and completes the entire set of steps to deploy the environment.

# Policy As Code

- Terraform Cloud enforces rules with policies written with HashiCorp Sentinel or Open Policy Agent (OPA)

- Policies are expressed as code and grouped into policy sets 

- Policy sets extend to one or more workspaces in your organization by assignment

![Policy as Code](images/policy-as-code.svg)

???
# Policy As Code

Policy as code is important for validation of the configuration that support multiple standards. The following are typical categories:

- **Resource Configuration** to confirm expected values are assigned according to standards, e.g.,

>> A group of VMs in a deployment should have Department and Enviroment tags (see example). 

- **Security Adherence** to validate that rules are within the boundaries of a well-defined sandbox model, e.g.,

>> Deny any Azure DB instance of an unencrypted database.

>> S3 buckets can expose data to internally trusted CIDRs only.

>> [Source](https://github.com/intel/policy-library-intel-Azure)

- **Corporate Compliance** to report on formalized frameworks such as CIS, or business compliance rules, e.g.,

>> CIS 4.1: Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22.

>> CIS 4.3: Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic

>> [Source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library/tree/master/cis/Azure/networking)

The categories above are not exhaustive and there are many other optional categories. Consider for instance, 

- **Ad hoc rules** to address situational scenarios, e.g., 

>> A development group should not deploy a fleet of VMs, any with 8-32 cores and/or 16-64GB memory, on a Friday afternoon past 3PM.

name: tfc-policy-as-code-validation
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Automated Policy Validation

- Policy validation overlaps with automated testing after the plan stage and before the apply stage of a workspace run cycle 

- Policies analyze patterns to filter properties and check configuration, security and compliance guidelines
  
- Enforcement Levels:
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Advisory: Warning when a policy fails</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Soft Mandatory: Must explicitly override a policy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hard Mandatory: Provisioning not allowed</td>
  </tr>
</table>

![Policy-as-code Workflow](images/policy_as_code_workflow.svg)

???
# Automated Policy Validation
- Automation in policy validations support workflow steps to ensure a deployment is within safe standards for completion. 
  
- Policy validations are **complementary to external testing sequences**, and policy validations can overlap in both intent and execution.
  
- For the audience, it is important to highlight context (use the diagram):
  
  1. Policy validation in a `run`, reads the output of a Terraform plan, compares the logical checks expressed in the policy.

  2. The process repeats for every policy in a set.
   
  3. Each check produces a binary answer - pass or fail.
   
  4. When a policy check fails, the assigned enforcement level determines whether a user with authority can override.

# Automated Testing

### Unit Testing
- Verify individual resources and configurations for expected values from a plan stage

![Unit Testing](images/unit-testing.svg)

### Contract Testing  
- Validate interactions between components with input and output results between deployments

![Unit Testing](images/contract-testing.svg)    

### Integration Testing
- Require active infrastructure resources to run and connect properly for acceptance

![Unit Testing](images/integration-testing.svg)  
???
# Automated Testing
- Policy validations are **complementary to external testing sequences**, and policy validations can overlap in both intent and execution. (___This is intentionally repeated from the previous slide to make this point clear.___)

- It must be clear that the concept of testing applies to the results observed from `plan` or `apply` stages. And, testing ___is not___ focused on confirming that the HCL syntax language is ok, and functional logic of a Terraform resource -as in the processing output.

> In other words, syntax testing happens as a `linting` step - analogous to `terraform validate`. While, confirming that the Terraform `Azure` provider works properly is a derivative from the joint development between Azure and HashiCorp.

-- 

- **Unit testing** looks at expected values in the Terraform plan.

- **Contract testing** compares infrastructure state. Highlight that Terraform Cloud allows state sharing between workspaces to explore key informational data points.

- **Integration testing** compares ___real___ resources and their interaction. These often include functional, policy and security domains. You can introduce `Run Tasks` as the vehicle to perform this type of testing. 
  
### ___"Terraform changes can be like #YOLO-driven development!"___
- The concepts in this slide are derived from Rosemary Wang's brilliant talk about [Test-driven development (TDD) for infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAcPuYfVt2c). The talk is just over half-hour in length and focuses on TDD to deploying and configuring infrastructure.

# Chapter 3 review

1. Terraform Cloud supports CLI, VCS and API workflows, adapting to different code-management practices  

2. Terraform Cloud enables testing and validation with policy-as-code, and sustains maintenance with deployment health-checks and alerting
???
# Chapter 3 review

1. Terraform execution is driven by different priorities and the workflows in Terraform Cloud are adaptive. VCS-driven workflows are important for groups that are focused specifically in Infrastructure-as-Code delivery. VCS-driven workflows shorten the knowledge gap between newhires and veterans because they use a common set of defined practices; and VCS-driven workflows flattens the adoption curve for consumers because not everyone needs to learn Terraform.

2. Policy validation is increasingly necessary for all aspect of \[Work\]-as-Code practices. In our case, we truly believe that there should not be ___#YOLO-driven development!___ when dealing with infrastructure deployments. Terraform Cloud provides deployment health-checks and alerting mechanisms to provide continual coverage of emerging changes in infrastructure deployments.

# Terraform Registry

- The Terraform Registry is a public library of trusted providers, modules, policies and run tasks used with Terraform deployments

- The resources are owned and maintained by a technology organization that maintains a partnership with HashiCorp through the Terraform Integration Program 

- To use a resource from the Registry, add it to your IaC configuration and Terraform  automatically downloads everything

![Terraform Registry](images/terraform_registry.svg)
???
# Terraform Registry
- The Terraform Registry helps organizations deploy infrastucture faster with consistency and trust. The Terraform Registry is essentially a service catalogue of IaC collections.
  
- Most organizations start their Terraform journey with fundamental instrumentation using the Terraform providers. This is all that is needed for deploying infrastructure.

- The progression of the Terraform journey into teams naturally leads to Terraform modules. These are like templates that teams often customize and use in deployments.

- HashiCorp is comoditazing this centralized registry and extending it to Policy-as-Code and Run Tasks. **Policy-As-Code** are libraries of policies that can be used within Terraform Cloud. **Run Tasks** are third-party integrations to tools and services to manage cost, security, compliance and more.

---
name: terraform-modules
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Terraform Modules

- Terraform modules are self-contained, composable and reusable infrastructure collections to build deployments

- Producer groups create curated modules as standard, templated offerings with configurable properties

- Modules are maintained in VCS repositories and published to a private registry in Terraform Cloud

![Terraform Modules](images/terraform_modules.svg)
???
# Terraform Modules

- Modules are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. Modules accelerate IaC development by focusing on prescriptive outcomes, customizing with variable properties, and simplifying the overall time investment to create a deployment.
  
- Modules in the Terraform Registry are free to use, and Terraform can download them automatically with an appropriate source and version in a module call block.

---
name: tfc-private-registry
class: col-2, minimal-list
# Private Module Registry

- Terraform Cloud includes a private registry where teams can set up modules and providers from private VCS repositories

- Many organizations use modules, providers, or policies that cannot or do not need to be publicly available

- Practitioners can copy modules from the public Terraform Registry, customize a private version, and publish to their Private Module Registry in Terraform Cloud

![PMR Workflow](images/pmr_technical_workflow.svg)
???
# Private Module Registry
- In Terraform Cloud, modules can be privatized to support the idea of a safe sandbox. 

- The further a module is configured, the least number of choices consumers need to make to automate their deployments.

- Private modules can referenced arbitrarily, but access to the resource follows the Terraform Cloud permissions model - meaning only teams with access privileges are able to access the module in the private registry, and execution of the code is only possible within a workspace in the same Terraform Cloud organization.

**INSTRUCTOR NOTE**: 

> You can bring up the idea of the Configuration Designer in Terraform Cloud - which leads to no-code provisioning. 

> No-code provisioning lets users deploy infrastructure in modules without writing any Terraform configuration, which makes your standards even easier to comply with, and removes the dependency on infrastructure teams or ticketing systems to give developers their required resources.

# Terraform API

- Terraform Cloud supports a rich HTTP API to perform most operations, replacing UI directives and CLI commands

- The TFC Terraform Provider is a practical API implementation for automating Terraform Cloud managment with Terraform (HCL) configuration code

- The Terraform CDK supports the following:

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>TypeScript |</td>
    <td>Python |</td>
    <td>Java |</td>
    <td>C# |</td>
    <td>Go</td>
</table>

![Terraform API](images/terraform_api.svg)
???
# Terraform API
- Mature IaC practices evolve to delegate tasks through automation. Terraform can be fully operated via API allowing organizations to easily integrate it into their existing deployment processes.

- Terraform Cloud supports multiple instrumentation technologies to implemented automated provisioning. The idea is to support adequate technology frameworks that support a service management practice.

- As a whole, the Terraform community provides testing frameworks, pipeline utilities, programming libraries, scripted templates, and repeatable examples to implement Terraform. What is relevant to emphasize is that all of these are 100% compatible with Terraform Cloud, and the time and effort to accomdate those resources is minimal. 

-

>> The real value is the utility of the Terraform echo system and the benefits of Terraform Cloud combined. In blunt words, technology is not a barrier... teams need to commit to the adoption journey.

# Service Management

- Terraform Cloud operations can be entirely managed via API, allowing organizations to integrate automated deployments in their existing business processes easily

- Trusted orchestrators use the Terraform API to procure resources and coordinate runtime operations 

- VCS integrations enhance team collaborations, code reviews and automated testing
   
![Terraform API](images/terraform_workflow.svg)
???
# Service Management
- In context of service management, the most visible value of Terraform Cloud is the ability to integrate resources, workflow and support capabilites seamlessly.

- Terraform Cloud is a cloud service and every functional area is designed with the intention to hand-off to a different one.

- In the diagram, the main highlight is the HashiCorp accent in pink, which symbolizes the functional areas where Terraform Cloud operates within the service workflow. 
  
- The illustration is simplified and incomplete as there are many other steps in a formal service management process. As in the illustration of the [Möbius strip](#tfc-team-collaboration), there are many examples of a process idea, and our intent is to explain where Terraform Cloud provides value on day-one.

# CICD Integration

Terraform Cloud integrates into your existing CI/CD pipelines, IT service management interfaces, and version control system processes.

![Terraform Cloud CIDC](images/terraform_cloud_cicd.svg)
???
# CICD Integration
- The illustration showcases the type of service layers involved in a CI/CD process. Here is a quick breakdown of each from left to right:

> | Service         | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Function                                                                             |
> | :-------------- | ------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | Consumer        |                                | The entity that makes a request for an infrastructure deployment                     |
| ServiceNow      |                                | IT Service management agent that handles requests and triggers work                  |
| Jenkins         |                                | Trusted orchestrator to provide step-by-step functions to deliver the infrastructure |
| GitHub          |                                | VCS to manage the lifecycle of IaC, Modules and PaC                                  |
| Terraform Cloud |                                | Cloud service to manage the lifecyle of an IaC deployment using Terraform            |
| Azure             |                                | Target environment                                                                   |

> **NOTABLY MISSING** is a secrets management service to safeguard secrets and to manage the lifecyle of those secrets.

- In the given example, anyone can make an argument that an organization can replace any of these service layers. That is true from a service management context, so it is important to think about the process first and the find the appropriate tooling.

<!-- > Here is a summary infrastructure automation solutions for the past 20 years:

> | 2000's | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | 2010's  | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | 2015's    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | 2020's |

- The overall infrastructure automation space is not new and there have been multiple generations of promising implementation solutions. The true realization of IaC had not happened until Terraform settled as the de facto solution. Terraform Cloud is a next-generation service to support that realization moving forward.

- It important to highlight the innovative approach from HashiCorp in the IaC space since 2012.

# Chapter 4 review

1. The Private Registry establishes a service catalogue of infrastructure deployments and options for no-code  

2. Terraform Cloud supports rich API options that adapt to your existing service model workflows and integrate agnostically into your delivery pipelines
???
# Chapter 4 review

1. The Public Terraform Registry and the Private Module Registry (PMR) serve a similar function purpose. The main difference is that the PMR is designed to support privacy and security controls.

2. When using Terraform Cloud, stake-holders should expect to maximize the use of automation to support service management processes via service delivery pipelines. The Terraform Cloud API promotes an API-first approach and it contains a vast array of instrumentation options to satisfy most use cases.
