  assignment: |-
    Open the Code Editor tab on the left. First get familiar with the menus. This is running the Visual Studio Code editor. You can also use the simpler "Text Editor" tab if you prefer.

    If you do use the VS Code Editor, please perform the following steps:

    Notice the menu bar with File, Edit, and other menus at the top of the VS Code Editor. You can find all the menus on this menu bar.

    You should see some files in the explorer bar on the left side menu. These are terraform config files for the hashicat application. Open file called "main.tf.

    Next you should install the HashiCorp Terraform extension to enable syntax highlighting in your code. Click on the extensions icon - it looks like four small boxes with one slightly out of position.

    Search for **HashiCorp** and select the "HashiCorp Terraform 2.x.y" extension. Click the blue **Install** or blue **Install in Remote** button to install the extension. Then click the icon with two pages under the File menu so you can see your Terraform files again.

    We have enabled auto-save in your Code Editor, so any changes you make will be saved as you type. You don't have to worry about saving files manually.

    We recommend executing all commands on the "Shell" tab. But you can also open and use a terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Code Editor by using the Terminal > New Terminal menu or the **<ctrl>-`** shortcut.

    If you do use the VS Code terminal, you can toggle its size up and down with the `^` and inverted `^` buttons above it. You can get rid of it with the garbage can and `x` icons.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform on Azure. We'll use the hashicat-azure example app in the rest of the challenges as you learn new Terraform skills.

      Terraform open source is a command line application that you can download and run from your laptop or virtual workstation.

      It is written in Go and runs on macOS, Linux or Windows. You can always download the latest version of Terraform from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Installing Terraform on your laptop or workstation is easy. You simply download the zip file, unpack it, and place it somewhere in your PATH.

      Check out this tutorial for step-by-step instructions:

      https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html

      We've pre-installed Terraform in your Instruqt lab environment for you.
  assignment: |-
    Let's start with some basic Terraform commands.
    Run the following commands in the "Shell" tab or in a terminal in the VS Code editor.

    Check the version of Terraform running on your machine:

    ```
    terraform version
    ```

    You can always get help if you're curious about command syntax:

    ```
    terraform help
    ```

    Terraform runs on Windows, OSX, or Linux. You can install it on your laptop or on a cloud based workstation. Terraform is also pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell.

    Today we'll be using the preconfigured Terraform workstation on the left for all our lab exercises.

    Terraform needs credentials to be able to connect to Azure and build resources.

    We've pre-installed some temporary credentials in your Instruqt training environment. These credentials are stored as environment variables. You should never store sensitive API keys inside your source code.

    Terraform can automatically read and use the environment variables that are in your shell environment.

    Run the following command to see your temporary credentials:
    ```
    env | grep ARM_CLIENT
    ```

    *Do not ever store your credentials in source code files*, as they can be accidentally exposed or copied to a public repository.

    The Terraform DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a declarative language that lets you build almost any type of infrastructure.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform will read anything in the current directory that ends in `*.tf` or `*.tfvars`.

      By convention most Terraform workspaces will contain `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files.

      You can also group your Terraform code into files by purpose. For example, you might place all your load balancer configuration code into a file called `load_balancer.tf`.
  assignment: |-
    We've downloaded some Terraform code onto your workstation. Run the following command to see the Terraform code files:
    ```
    ls *.tf
    ```
    The same files are visible in the file explorer pane on the left. Terraform files are marked with the purple T icon.

    Terraform code always ends with a `.tf` extension. You can have as many Terraform files as you want, but these three are commonly created first:

    **main.tf** - Where most of your Terraform code is stored. This is the part that does the building of resources.<br>
    **variables.tf** - Use this file to define which variables will be available to your users.<br>
    **outputs.tf** - This file contains outputs that will be shown at the end of a successful Terraform run.

    Files that end in anything other than `*.tf` or `*.tfvars` are ignored by Terraform.

    Terraform needs a provider to talk to cloud APIs. The provider is the bridge that connects Terraform core to your infrastructure providers.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The Terraform core program isn't very useful by itself. Terraform needs the help of a **provider** to be able to talk to cloud APIs. Terraform has hundreds of different providers. You can browse the provider list here:

      https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers

      Today we'll be using the **azurerm** provider. AzureRM stands for Azure Resource Manager.
  assignment: |-
    We have downloaded some Terraform code for the HashiCat application. We'll be using this source code for the rest of the track.

    Before we can do anything with Terraform we need to initialize our workspace. Run the following command in your "Shell" tab:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
    The `terraform init` command scans your Terraform code, identifies any providers that are needed, and downloads them.

    Run the following command to verify that the azurerm provider was installed under the ".terraform" directory::
    ```
    ls .terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp
    ```
    This hidden directory is where all modules and plugins are stored.

    Terraform has a built in validation tester. This is useful to see whether your Terraform code is valid and parses correctly.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: Terraform has a built-in syntax checker. You can run it with the `terraform
      validate` command.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform comes with a built-in subcommand called **validate**. This is useful when you want to do a quick syntax check of your code to make sure it parses correctly.

    Click on the File Explorer icon on the left. It looks like a stack of papers.

    Edit the main.tf file and remove the double quotes between `azurerm_resource_group` and `myresourcegroup` on line 14 of the file, keeping the space that was between them.

    Validate your code:

    ```
    terraform validate
    ```

    Now put the double quotes back in line 14 and run the validate command again. This time you should pass the validation test.

    **terraform validate** is most often used in automated CI/CD test pipelines. It allows you to quickly catch errors in your code before any other steps are taken.

  assignment: |-
    Run the **terraform plan** command:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
    When you run this command Terraform will prompt you to enter the `prefix` variable.

    Enter a short string of lower-case letters and/or numbers. We recommend that you use your first and last name.

    **Keep your prefix string all lower case, and between 5-12 characters long. Do not use an underscore in your prefix.**

    The prefix will become part of your application hostname, and therefore must be DNS-compliant. Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7) letters from a to z, the digits from 0 to 9, and the hyphen (-).  A hostname may not start with a hyphen.

    In Terraform all variables must be declared (with or without an optional default value) before you can use them. Variables are usually declared in the "variables.tf" file although they can also be declared in other "*.tf" files. Their values can be set in the "terraform.tfvars" file and in other ways which we'll explore later.

    Open the "terraform.tfvars" file and set your `prefix` variable by deleting the `# ` at the beginning of the line and replacing "yourname" with your own name (first and last with or without a hyphen between them and all lower case).

    Now run `terraform plan` again. This time you won't have to enter your prefix manually.

    Terraform is flexible enough to deploy infrastructure anywhere in the world. You can easily provision your applications in different geographical regions by simply changing a single variable.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You can override any variable defined in the "variables.tf" file by setting it in your personal `terraform.tfvars` file.

      In this challenge, you will pick the location where your Azure resources should be deployed.
  assignment: |-
    In the previous challenge we set our `prefix` variable in the "terraform.tfvars" file. Let's set another variable that will determine the location where your Azure infrastructure will be deployed.

    First run another plan so you'll be able to compare what happens after you change the location.

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

    Choose an Azure location near to you but different from the default one which is "centralus". Add a `location` variable to your "terraform.tfvars" file, setting it to your desired location such as `East US`, `UK South`, or `Southeast Asia`. You can also use shorter names like `eastus`, `uksouth`, or `southeastasia`; in fact, Terraform will convert the longer names with spaces to the shorter names without them.

    See this [page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/) for a list of valid Azure locations (which shows the longer names with spaces).

    Choosing a location close to you can help improve speed and performance.

    Once you've set your location variable try running `terraform plan` again. What's different this time?

    Remember that you can set values for any variable declared in your "variables.tf" file in the "terraform.tfvars" file.

The graph data is in [DOT graph description language format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)). There are several graphing tools you can use to visualize this data, including the free Blast Radius tool. You can learn more about Blast Radius here:

    Explore the Terraform graph for your infrastructure. Dependencies are automatically mapped out for you. This graph was generated using the free Blast Radius tool.

    **NOTE:** Due to a known bug you may not be able to drag and zoom the graph. The main point of this exercise is to see how terraform maps out complex infrastructure. So don't worry if your graph doesn't show color.

    Terraform can map out the complex web of dependencies between hundreds of interconnected resources.

    There are several ways to configure Terraform variables. So far we've been using the **terraform.tfvars** file to set our variables. Try re-deploying your application with different **height** and **width** variables on the command line. Reload the webapp after each apply to observe any changes.

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var height=600 -var width=800
    ```

    Next try setting an environment variable that Terraform can read. Run this command to set the placeholder variable:

    ```
    export TF_VAR_placeholder=placedog.net
    ```

    Run another `terraform apply -auto-approve` command:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Now try it again with the same variable set differently on the command line:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var placeholder=placebear.com
    ```

    Which variable took precedence? Why?

  assignment: |-
    During this challenge and the next one, you'll use the remote state feature of Terraform Cloud to store your state file in the cloud. In order to do this you'll need a Terraform Cloud account. Click on the URL below and sign up for a free account if you don't have one already:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Once you're signed into Terraform Cloud create a new organization called YOURNAME-training. Replace YOURNAME with your own name or other text.

    Next you'll be prompted to create a workspace. You can skip the VCS integration step by clicking the "CLI-driven workflow" panel. Name your workspace **hashicat-azure**.

    **Note:** If you already have a **hashicat-azure** workspace, please delete the workspace by selecting the **Settings >> Destruction and Deletion** menu, clicking the "Delete from Terraform Cloud" button, typing "hashicat-azure" to confirm, and then clicking the "Delete workspace" button. Then re-create it as above. Doing this avoids possible problems with mis-matched state versions when executing local runs after having executed remote runs. This could happen if you played the [Terraform Cloud with Azure](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/terraform-cloud-azure) track and then played this track.

    Run `terraform version` on the "Shell" tab and then set the **Terraform Version** to match on the workspace's **Settings >> General** settings page.

    Also, change the **Execution Mode** to **Local**.

    Be sure to save your settings by clicking the "Save settings" button at the bottom of the page! This will allow us to run Terraform commands from our workstation with local variables, which we'll do in the next challenge.

      With *local* execution mode the Terraform commands and variables all remain

      With *remote* execution mode Terraform runs in a Terraform Cloud
      container environment. All variables must be configured in the cloud environment with this method.
  assignment: |-
    During this challenge we'll configure Terraform Cloud as a remote state backend, and then migrate our existing state file to Terraform Cloud.

    Edit the `remote_backend.tf` file and replace the YOURORGANIZATION and YOURWORKSPACE placeholders with your org name and workspace name.

    Let's generate a new **user token** for use on your workstation. Visit the User Settings > Tokens page in Terraform Cloud:

    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens

    Click on the **Create an API token** button. You can name the token whatever you like. Copy the entire token using your mouse or the small copy-paste icon.

    Back in the Instruqt track, you need to add your API token to a file called "credentials.tfrc.json". You can do this in two different ways:

    The easier way is to select the "Credentials File" tab and open the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file directly.

    But if you prefer to use the VS Code Editor, you can use the File > Open menu, click on "..", select ".terraform.d", and then select the "credentials.tfrc.json" file.

    In either case, replace the part that says YOURTOKEN with what you copied from Terraform Cloud. If you use the "Credentials File" tab,  sure to save the file.

    Your token is now safely stored in the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file.

    Now run `terraform init` to migrate your state to Terraform Cloud.

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    Type "yes" when it prompts you to migrate your state into Terraform Cloud.

    Your state is now safely stored in Terraform Cloud. You can check this on the States tab of your workspace.

    Run a `terraform apply -auto-approve` and watch your state file evolve with each change. You can browse through previous state files with the Terraform Cloud UI.

    You'll need to type "yes" when prompted to destroy your infrastructure. This is a safety feature to help prevent accidental deletion of important resources.

    Wait until the destroy action has completely finished before clicking on the *Check* button.

    Depending on the version of Terraform you are using, it is possible that the destroy action will fail. That will be resolved in a future version of Terraform.
