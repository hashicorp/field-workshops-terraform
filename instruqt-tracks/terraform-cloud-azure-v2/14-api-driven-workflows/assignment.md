    You've mostly been using the Terraform Cloud Web UI and command line
    interface (CLI) to build infrastructure. The devops team needs to integrate with
    their CI/CD tool via the API.

    Lars sends you a chat message:

    > Hey Sysadmin, we have this new continuous integration tool that the developers
    are using to test their application code. I'd like you to test some API calls
    to our Terraform Cloud organization and workspaces. Can you please take a look
    at this and learn how the API works?

In the final challenge you'll directly interact with the Terraform Cloud API.

- Terraform Cloud has a rich API that lets you do everything you can do in the GUI and more.

- Intermediate and advanced users utilize the API to create complex integrations that work with external systems.

1. API Subsets
===

The Terraform Cloud API will continue to evolve, but we consider it stable for general use, and HashiCorp will maintain all stable API endpoints in a backwards compatible manner.

### 1.1 HTTP API Core
This is the most straight-forward method to access the Terraform Cloud API. All requests must include the following:

<w>Authentication</w> All requests must be authenticated with a bearer token.

<w>Request Type</w> A valid HTTP operation such as GET, POST, etc. that is supported by the API endpoint.

<w>API Endpoint</w> The URL for the operation. The baseline for the URL is <x>https://app.terraform.io/api/v2</x>.
---
Examples:

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab to test the API with the following:
```bash
# Shows details for a given user account.
# GET /account/details
curl -s \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  --request GET \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/account/details


```

- Operations normally require a data transformation utility to filter the response payload. For instance, we use the `jq` utility to read and manage the response:
```bash
# Shows the entitlements for an organization.
# GET /organizations/:organization_name/entitlement-set
curl -s \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/entitlement-set \
  | jq


```

### 1.2 TFE Terraform Provider

Before planning an API integration, it is important to consider whether the [TFE Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs) meets your needs.

 It can't create or approve runs in response to arbitrary events, but it's a useful tool for managing your organizations, teams, and workspaces as code.

 - In the workshop we assumed **producer** and **consumer** roles. The producer code is in the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>terraform-cloud</t> folder as it helps create, read, update and delete the resources in Terraform Cloud.

### 1.3 CDK for Terraform

The Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) allows you to use familiar programming languages to define cloud infrastructure and provision it through HashiCorp Terraform.

- This gives you access to the entire Terraform ecosystem without learning HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and lets you leverage the power of your existing toolchain for testing, dependency management, etc.

It currently supports TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go.

2. CRUD Operations
===
For most fundamental target operations, the best practice is to employ create, read, update and delete methods to maintain control.

- In this example, the target object is a `workspace`, and, although the API supports more than a dozen operations, our API integration planning considers basic CRUD operations first.

### 2.1 - Create
- Create a workspace.

```bash
cd /root/terraform-api

# Create a workspace in the given organization
# POST /organizations/:organization_name/workspaces
# This POST endpoint requires a JSON object
curl -s \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  --request POST \
  --data @create_payload.json \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces


```

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Workspaces</x>-<x>hashicat-api</x>-<x>Overview</x>. Please see the example image below.

![API Create](../assets/api_create.png)

### 2.2 - Read
- Read the properties of the workspace.

```bash
cd /root/terraform-api

# Retrieve details on a workspace
# GET /organizations/:organization_name/workspaces/:name
curl -s \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces \
  | jq '.data|.[]|select(.attributes.name | contains("hashicat-api"))'


```

### 2.3 - Update
- Update the workspace.

```bash
cd /root/terraform-api

# Update a workspace in the given organization
# PATCH /organizations/:organization_name/workspaces/:name
# This PATCH endpoint requires a JSON object
curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  --request PATCH \
  --data @update_payload.json \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces/hashicat-api


```
- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Workspaces</x>-<x>hashicat-api</x>-<x>Overview</x>. Please see the example image below.

![API Update](../assets/api_update.png)

### 2.4 - Delete
- Delete the workspace.

```bash
cd /root/terraform-api

# Delete a workspace in the given organization
# DELETE /organizations/:organization_name/workspaces/:name
curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  --request DELETE \
  https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces/hashicat-api


```
- On the Terraform Cloud portal and reload your page. Please see the example image below.

3. Automation with wrappers
===
Terraform Cloud's main unit of organization is a workspace. A workspace is a collection of everything Terraform needs to run: a Terraform configuration (usually from a VCS repo), values for that configuration's variables, and state data to keep track of operations between runs.

Automation of Terraform can come in various forms, and to varying degrees. The Vending Machine simulates how teams continue to run Terraform locally but use wrapper scripts to prepare a consistent working directory for Terraform to run in, while other teams run Terraform entirely within an orchestration tool such as Jenkins.

### 3.1 - Vending Machine (self-service)

- Simulate a basic business request for new infrastructure. Use the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab to run the following:

```bash
cd /root/scripts
bash vending_macheen.bash


```
- There is an assumption that the infrastructure deliverables are supported with tested and secure code modules.

- The workflow manager is responsible for picking the appropriate implementation of those modules and allocating Terraform Cloud resources.

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Projects & workspaces</x> and pick <x>Vending_Macheen</x> to see your resources. Please see the example image below.

![API Vending Macheen](../assets/api_vending_macheen.png)

- You can run the script as many times as desired. When satisfied, remove the resources with the following:

```bash
cd /root/terraform-api
terraform destroy -auto-approve


```

4. Automation with CI/CD
===

While Terraform Cloud offers version control system integrations, including GitHub, using CI/CD tasks in your workflow enables you to add status checks before or after Terraform Cloud remote runs are triggered, better adapting Terraform Cloud to your use case.

To illustrate, set up GitHub Actions for your deployment.

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab to update your <x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x> workspace configuration. In this case, we are removing the VCS setup:

```bash
cd /root/terraform-cloud
terraform apply -auto-approve


```

- Create a secret to access Terraform Cloud from your GitHub deployment repo.

```bash
# Move to /root/hashicat-azure which has
# a proper .git and GitHub credentials
cd /root/hashicat-azure

# Configure the TFC Token so Github Actions
# can interact with Terraform Cloud
gh secret set TF_API_TOKEN \
  --body "$TFC_TOKEN"


```

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab and expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>hashicat-azure</t> folder and open the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>.github/workflows</t> folders.

- Open the file <t><img src="../assets/tf-icon.png"/>terraform.yaml</t> to preview the actions peformed by the GitHub worker.

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab and update the deployment.

```bash
# We're working on /root/hashicat-azure
cd /root/hashicat-azure

git add .
git commit -a -m "Adding GitHub Actions"
git push -u origin main


```
- On your Web browser, navigate to your GitHub repository page. On the top menu look for <x>Actions</x> and expand the <x>Terraform</x> job. Please see the example image below.

![GitHub Actions TF Job](../assets/github_actions_tf_job.png)

- Expand and explore any of the job steps. This example showcases how the work is triggered from the CICD workflow, but the permissions for users, Cloud identity authorization, deployment policies and private module resources are all managed in Terraform Cloud.

---

Congratulations, Senior Cloud Admin. With this exercise we conclude that:

- Terraform Cloud provides a fundamental and secure API to manage its features.

- The [Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs) meet most of our needs to support prescriptive workflows.

- You can use the API endpoints to create your own CRUD operations wrappers to integrate into your workflows.

- The Terraform CLI can be used across headless operations to support automation with CI/CD operations across different engines.
