  assignment: |-
    Open the "Code Editor" tab on the left. You'll see some terraform configuration files for the hashicat application. Open the file called "main.tf". Note that the file type at the bottom of the screen was automatically set to "hcl" to give optimized syntax highlighting and colors.

    When you edit any of these files, you will see a blue dot and a disk icon on the tab above it. **Be sure to click the disk icon to save your changes!** There is no "auto-saving" in the Instruqt editor!

    Throughout this track, please execute all commands on the "Shell" tab.

    You should see some files in the explorer bar on the left side menu. These are terraform config files for the hashicat application.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform.

    Click the **Check** button to continue.
