  teaser: |
    Configure your code editor with the Terraform extension and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Open the Code Editor tab on the left. First get familiar with the menus. This is running the Visual Studio Code editor. You can also use the simpler "Text Editor" tab if you prefer.

    Find the "hamburger" or triple-line menu on the top of the navigation bar on the left. It's right underneath the Instruqt mascot logo. This is your Main Menu. You can find all the other VSC menu options here.

    You should see some files in the explorer bar on the left side menu. These are terraform config files for the hashicat application.

    Next you should install the Terraform extension to enable syntax highlighting in your code. Click on the extensions icon - it looks like four small boxes.

    Search for **Terraform** and be sure to select the "Terraform 1.4.x" extension from mauve. **Do not select the "HashiCorp Terraform 2.x.y" extension** since it will not work in the version of the the Visual Studio Code Server that this track is using. Click the green **Install** button to install the extension. Then click the **Reload Required** button to activate it.

    We have enabled auto-save in your Code Editor, so any changes you make will be saved as you type. You don't have to worry about saving files manually.

    **Please execute all commands on the "Shell" tab.** While the Code Editor allows you to open a terminal window inside it, it is not currently possible to paste `terraform` commands from the assignment into it within Instruqt.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform on GCP. We'll use the hashicat-gcp example app in the rest of the challenges as you learn new Terraform skills.

    Click the **Check** button to continue.

    Learn Terraform basics and command line syntax.
  assignment: |-
    Let's start with some basic Terraform commands.
    Run the following commands in the "Shell" tab.
    Check the version of Terraform running on your machine:
    ```
    terraform version
    ```
    You can always get help if you're curious about command syntax:
    ```
    terraform help
    ```
    Terraform runs on Windows, OSX, or Linux. You can install it on your laptop or on a cloud based workstation.

    Today we'll be using the preconfigured Terraform workstation on the left for all our lab exercises.
  notes:

      Installing Terraform on your laptop or workstation is easy. You simply download the zip file, unpack it, and place it somewhere in your PATH.

      Check out this tutorial for step-by-step instructions:

      https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html

      We've pre-installed Terraform in your Instruqt lab environment for you.

    Connecting to GCP with Google Credentials.
  assignment: |-
    In order to authenticate to GCP and build resources, Terraform requires you to provide a set of credentials, backed by an appropriate IAM policy.

    For this training environment, we have prepared some temporary GCP credentials and stored them as an environment variable. Terraform will automatically read and use the environment variables that are configured in your shell environment.

    Run the following command in the "Shell" tab to see your temporary credentials:

    ```
    echo $GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
    ```

    *Do not ever store your credentials in source code files*, as they can be accidentally exposed or copied to a public repository.

    The Terraform DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a declarative language that lets you build almost any type of infrastructure.
  assignment: |-
    We've downloaded some Terraform code onto your workstation. Run the following command to see the Terraform code files:
      ```
      ls *.tf
      ```
      <br>
      The same files are visible in the file explorer pane on the left. Terraform files are marked with the purple T icon.

      Terraform code always ends with a `.tf` extension. You can have as many Terraform files as you want, but these three are commonly created first:

      **main.tf** - Where most of your Terraform code is stored. This is the part that does the building of resources.<br>
      **variables.tf** - Use this file to define which variables will be available to your users.<br>
      **outputs.tf** - This file contains outputs that will be shown at the end of a successful Terraform run.

      Files that end in anything other than `*.tf` or `*.tfvars` are ignored by Terraform.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform will read anything in the current directory that ends in `*.tf` or `*.tfvars`.

      By convention most Terraform workspaces will contain `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files.

      You can also group your Terraform code into files by purpose. For example, you might place all your load balancer configuration code into a file called `load_balancer.tf`.

    Terraform needs a provider to talk to cloud APIs. The provider is the bridge that connects Terraform core to your infrastructure providers.
  assignment: |-
    We have downloaded some Terraform code for the HashiCat application. We'll be using this source code for the rest of the track.

    Before we can do anything with Terraform we need to initialize our workspace. Run the following command in your "Shell" tab:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    The `terraform init` command scans your Terraform code, identifies any providers that are needed, and downloads them.

    Run the following command to take a peek inside the `.terraform` directory:

    ```
    ls .terraform/plugins/linux_amd64/
    ```
    <br>
    This hidden directory is where all modules and plugins are stored.
  notes:

      The Terraform core program isn't very useful by itself. Terraform needs the help of a *provider* to be able to talk to cloud APIs. Terraform has hundreds of different providers. You can browse the provider list here:

  teaser: |
    Terraform has a built in validation tester. This is useful to see whether your Terraform code is valid and parses correctly.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform comes with a built-in subcommand called *validate*. This is useful when you want to do a quick syntax check of your code to make sure it parses correctly.

    Click on the File Explorer icon on the left. It looks like a stack of papers.

    Edit the main.tf file and remove the double quotes between `google_compute_network` and `hashicat` on line 7 of the file, keeping the space that was between them.

    Validate your code:

    ```
    terraform validate
    ```

    Now put the double quotes back in line 7 and run the `validate` command again. This time you should pass the validation test.

    `terraform validate` is most often used in automated CI/CD test pipelines. It allows you to quickly catch errors in your code before any other steps are taken.

    Terraform variables allow you to customize your infrastructure without editing any code. You can use the same Terraform code to deploy dev, staging and production but with different variables.
  assignment: |-
    We've created a `terraform.tfvars` file for you to edit. This is a special file where you can set any variables you wish to change from their defaults.

    Variables are *declared* in the **variables.tf** file. They are *set* or *defined* in the `terraform.tfvars` file.

    In Terraform all variables must be declared (with or without an optional default value) before you can use them.

    Open the `terraform.tfvars` file and set your prefix variable there.

    Now run `terraform plan` again. This time you won't have to enter your prefix manually.

    Terraform creates a graph of all the infrastructure defined in your code.
  assignment: |-
    Try running the `terraform graph` command:

    ```
    terraform graph
    ```

    This generates code that can be used to create a visual map of your infrastructure. The graph data is in [DOT graph description language format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)). There are several graphing tools you can use to visualize this data, including the free Blast Radius tool. You can learn more about Blast Radius here:

    https://28mm.github.io/blast-radius-docs/

    Start up a Blast Radius server with the following command:

    ```
    blast-radius --serve .
    ```

    Now switch to the **Terraform Graph** tab to view the infrastructure graph. If the web page is blank, you may need to click the reload icon in Instruqt, which is directly to the right of the **Terraform Graph** tab and looks like a circular arrow.

    Explore the Terraform graph for your infrastructure. Dependencies are automatically mapped out for you. This graph was generated using the free Blast Radius tool.

    **NOTE:** Due to a known bug you may not be able to drag and zoom the graph. The main point of this exercise is to see how terraform maps out complex infrastructure. So don't worry if your graph doesn't show color.

    Terraform uses this graph to determine which resources can be built in parallel for maximum efficiency.

  assignment: |-
    Now that we've configured our required prefix variable we can apply our Terraform configuration.

    Run the `terraform plan` command first to see what will happen:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

    Confirm the proper prefix is displayed in the plan output. Look for **# google_compute_network.hashicat** and find the output next to **+ name**.

    Then run `terraform apply` and watch your resources being built.

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    You'll need to enter **yes** when Terraform prompts you with the "Do you want to perform these actions?" question.

    Right now our code only defines a VPC network. We'll be building upon this starting point in the next challenge.

    Terraform resources are like building blocks. You can continue adding more blocks until your infrastructure reaches the desired state.
  assignment: |-
    Open the **main.tf** file again and uncomment the next resource block in the file. The type of resource is **google_compute_subnetwork** and it is named **hashicat**.

    Uncomment the code by removing the `#` characters from the beginning of each line.

    Now run `terraform apply` again. Observe the results.

    Look at the **network** parameter inside the google_compute_subnetwork resource. See how it points back at the first resource in the file? The subnet resource inherits settings from the VPC network.

    Terraform is flexible enough to deploy infrastructure anywhere in the world. You can easily provision your applications in different geographical regions by simply changing a single variable.
  assignment: |-
    In one of the previous challenges we set our **prefix** variable. Let's set another variable.

    Choose the GCP region nearest to you and set the **region** variable in your `terraform.tfvars` file. You may need to close and re-open the file if it appears blank.

    You can find the details of valid GCP regions here:

    https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/

    as well as a more succinct list of valid region ids here:

    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/#locations

    us-west1 - Oregon<br>
    asia-southeast1 - Singapore<br>
    australia-southeast1 - Sydney<br>
    europe-west2 - London

      It's quiz time!
  answers:
  - Terraform runs without any plan
  - Terraform reads the previous plan and then applies it
  - Terraform runs a new plan right before the apply
  - None of the above

  teaser: |
    Terraform works great with many different provisioning tools including Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Bash, and Powershell.
  assignment: |-
    Open the `main.tf` file in the Code Editor. Scroll down until you find the `remote-exec` provisioner block, or search the file and find it with CTRL-F.

    Add the following two lines at the end of the inline list of commands:

    ```
    "sudo apt -y install cowsay",
    "cowsay Mooooooooooo!",
    ```

    Now run another `terraform apply -auto-approve` to apply your changes:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```
    <br>
    Scroll back through the log output. You should see an ASCII art cow saying "Moooooooo!"
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: Terraform provisioners run once at creation time. They do not run on
      subsequent applies, except in special circumstances. (Like this training lab...)
  - type: text
    contents: We've made some special adjustments to force the provisioner run every
      time you type terraform apply. This is so you can practice playing with provisioners
      without destroying and recreating your virtual machine every time you make a
      change.

    Outputs are used to convey useful information such as IP addresses, application URLs or other useful data.
  assignment: |-
    Open the **outputs.tf** file in the Code Editor. Note the catapp_url output in the file.

    Add a second output for the `private_ip` of your web server. It's going to look a lot like the first output but will instead output the internal private IP address instead of the external one.

    Name your output `private_ip`.

    You may refer to the docs page to see what types of outputs are valid:

    [Terraform GCP Docs - Click Here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/2.20.3/docs/resources/compute_instance)
    [Terraform Outputs Docs - Click Here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html)

    Run the Terraform refresh command to view your new output:

    ```
    terraform refresh
    ```

    You can run the Terraform output command to view all your outputs:

    ```
    terraform output
    ```

  title: "\U0001F436 Fun With Variables"
  teaser: |
    Variables give the consumers of your Terraform code an easy way to customize their infrastructure.
  assignment: |-
    There are several ways to configure Terraform variables. So far we've been using the `terraform.tfvars` file to set our variables. Try re-deploying your application with different **height** and **width** variables on the command line. Reload the webapp after each apply to observe any changes.

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var height=600 -var width=800
    ```
    <br>
    Next try setting an environment variable that Terraform can read. Run this command to set the placeholder variable:

    ```
    export TF_VAR_placeholder=placedog.net
    ```

    Run another `terraform apply -auto-approve` command:
    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Now try it again with the same variable set differently on the command line:
    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var placeholder=placebear.com
    ```

    Which variable took precedence? Why?
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform variables have five levels of precedence. 1=highest 5=lowest:

      1. Command line flag - run as a command line switch
      1. Configuration file - set in your terraform.tfvars file
      1. Environment variable - part of your shell environment
      1. Default Config - default value in variables.tf
      1. User manual entry - if not specified, prompt the user for entry
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Here are some other fun placeholder sites you can try with the **placeholder** variable:

      placedog.net<br>
      placebear.com<br>

  title: ☁️ Terraform Cloud Setup
  teaser: |
    Terraform Cloud offers unlimited free Terraform state storage for users. Safeguard your state files by storing them remotely in Terraform Cloud.
  assignment: |-
    During this challenge and the next one, you'll use the remote state feature of Terraform Cloud to store your state file in the cloud. In order to do this you'll need a Terraform Cloud account. Click on the URL below and sign up for a free account if you don't have one already:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Once you're signed into Terraform Cloud create a new organization called YOURNAME-training. Replace YOURNAME with your own name or other text.

    Next you'll be prompted to create a workspace. You can skip the VCS integration step by clicking the "No VCS Connection" button. Name your workspace **hashicat-gcp**.

    Now go into the workspace's **Settings >> General** settings page and change the Execution Mode to local. Be sure to save your settings! This will allow us to run Terraform commands from our workstation with local variables, which we'll do in the next challenge.

    The terraform command line tool can store its state in Terraform Cloud. All that is required is a user token.
  assignment: |-
    During this challenge we'll configure Terraform Cloud as a remote state backend, and then migrate our existing state file to Terraform Cloud.

    Edit the `remote_backend.tf` file and replace the YOURORGANIZATION and YOURWORKSPACE placeholders with your org name and workspace name.

    Let's generate a new **user token** for use on your workstation. Visit the User Settings > Tokens page in Terraform Cloud:

    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens

    Click on the **Create an API token** button. You can name the token whatever you like. Copy the entire token using your mouse or the small copy-paste icon.

    Next, go back to your Instruqt workstation code editor and open the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file. Replace the part that says YOURTOKEN with what you copied from Terraform Cloud. Close the file.

    Your token is now safely stored in the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file.

    Now run `terraform init` to migrate your state to Terraform Cloud.

    ```
    terraform init
    ```
    <br>
    Type "yes" when it prompts you to migrate your state into Terraform Cloud.

    Your state is now safely stored in Terraform Cloud.

    Run a `terraform apply -auto-approve` and watch your state file evolve with each change. You can browse through previous state files with the Terraform Cloud UI.

      With *local* execution mode the Terraform commands and variables all remain
      on your workstation.

      With *remote* execution mode Terraform runs in a Terraform Cloud
      container environment. All variables must be configured in the cloud environment with this method.

  teaser: |
    Terraform can build infrastructure and also destroy it when you are done using it. This helps control costs and reduce infrastructure sprawl.
  assignment: |-
    Run the following command to destroy your infrastructure:

    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
    <br>
    You'll need to type "yes" when prompted to destroy your infrastructure. This is a safety feature to help prevent accidental deletion of important resources.

    Wait until the destroy action has completely finished before clicking on the **Check** button.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: Terraform can destroy infrastructure as easily as it can build it. Use
      Terraform with caution.
