      Terraform Community Edition is a command line application that you can download and run from your laptop or virtual workstation.

      It is written in Go and runs on macOS, Linux or Windows. You can always download the latest version of Terraform from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Installing Terraform on your laptop or workstation is easy. You simply download the zip file, unpack it, and place it somewhere in your PATH.

      Check out this tutorial for step-by-step instructions:

      https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html

      We've pre-installed Terraform in your Instruqt lab environment for you.
  assignment: |-
    Let's start with some basic Terraform commands.
    Run the following commands on the "Shell" tab.

    Check the version of Terraform running on your machine:

    ```
    terraform version
    ```

    You can always get help if you're curious about command syntax:

    ```
    terraform --help
    ```

    Terraform runs on Windows, OSX, or Linux. You can install it on your laptop or on a cloud based workstation.

    Today we'll be using the preconfigured Terraform workstation in the "Code Editor" and "Shell" tabs on the left for all our lab exercises.

  assignment: |-
    In order to authenticate to AWS and build resources, Terraform requires you to provide a set of credentials, backed by an appropriate IAM policy.

    For this training environment, we have prepared some temporary AWS credentials and stored them as environment variables. Terraform will automatically read and use the environment variables that are configured in your shell environment.

    Run the following commands on the "Shell" tab:

    ```
    echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```
    You should see valid AWS keys. If not, return to the track home page by clicking the **Close** button, stop the track, and then restart it.

    *Do not ever store your credentials in source code files*, as they can be accidentally exposed or copied to a public repository.

    The Terraform DSL (Domain Specific Language) is a declarative language that lets you build almost any type of infrastructure.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform will read anything in the current directory that ends in `*.tf` or `*.tfvars`.

      By convention most Terraform workspaces will contain `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files.

      You can also group your Terraform code into files by purpose. For example, you might place all your load balancer configuration code into a file called `load_balancer.tf`.
  assignment: |-
    We've downloaded some Terraform code onto your workstation. Run the following command to see the Terraform code files:
      ```
      ls *.tf
      ```
      The same files are visible in the file explorer pane on the left. Terraform files are marked with the purple T icon.

      Terraform code always ends with a `.tf` extension. You can have as many Terraform files as you want, but these three are commonly created first:

      **main.tf** - Where most of your Terraform code is stored. This is the part that does the building of resources.<br>
      **variables.tf** - Use this file to define which variables will be available to your users.<br>
      **outputs.tf** - This file contains outputs that will be shown at the end of a successful Terraform run.

      Files that end in anything other than `*.tf` or `*.tfvars` are ignored by Terraform.

    Terraform needs a provider to talk to cloud APIs. The provider is the bridge that connects Terraform core to your infrastructure providers.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The Terraform core program isn't very useful by itself. Terraform needs the help of a *provider* to be able to talk to cloud APIs. Terraform has hundreds of different providers. You can browse the provider list here:

      https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers

      Today we'll be using a few different providers, but the main one is the *aws* provider.
  assignment: |-
    We have downloaded some Terraform code for the HashiCat application. We'll be using this source code for the rest of the track.

    Before we can do anything with Terraform we need to initialize our workspace. Run the following command in your "Shell" tab:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    The `terraform init` command scans your Terraform code, identifies any providers that are needed, and downloads them.

    Run the following command to verify that the aws provider was installed under the ".terraform" directory:

    ```
    ls .terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp
    ```

    This hidden directory is where all modules and plugins are stored.

    Terraform has a built in validation tester. This is useful to see whether your Terraform code is valid and parses correctly.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: Terraform has a built-in syntax checker. You can run it with the `terraform
      validate` command.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform comes with a built-in subcommand called *validate*. This is useful when you want to do a quick syntax check of your code to make sure it parses correctly.

    Edit the main.tf file and remove the double quotes between `aws_vpc` and `hashicat` on line 14 of the file, keeping the space that was between them. Save the file.

    Validate your code:

    ```
    terraform validate
    ```

    Now put the double quotes back in line 14, save the file, and run the validate command again. This time you should pass the validation test.

    `terraform validate` is most often used in automated CI/CD test pipelines. It allows you to quickly catch errors in your code before any other steps are taken.

    Terraform variables allow you to customize your infrastructure without editing any code. You can use the same Terraform code to deploy dev, staging and production but with different variables.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: The `terraform.tfvars` file is a convenient place for users to configure
      their variables.
  assignment: |-
    In Terraform all variables must be declared (with or without an optional default value) before you can use them. Variables are usually declared in the "variables.tf" file although they can also be declared in other "*.tf" files. Their values can be set in the "terraform.tfvars" file and in other ways which we'll explore later.

    Open the "terraform.tfvars" file and set your `prefix` variable by deleting the `# ` at the beginning of the line and replacing "yourname" with your own name (first and last with or without a hyphen between them and all lower case).

    **Be sure to click the disk icon above the file to save your change!**

    Now run `terraform plan` again. This time you won't have to enter your prefix manually.

    Terraform is flexible enough to deploy infrastructure anywhere in the world. You can easily provision your applications in different geographical regions by simply changing a single variable.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      You can override any variable defined in the "variables.tf" file by setting it in your personal `terraform.tfvars` file.

      In this challenge, you will pick the location where your AWS resources should be deployed.
  assignment: |-
    In the previous challenge we set our `prefix` variable in the "terraform.tfvars" file. Let's set another variable that will determine the location where your AWS infrastructure will be deployed.

    First run another plan so you'll be able to compare what happens after you change the location.

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

    Choose an AWS region near you but different from the default one which is "us-east-1". Add a `region` variable to your "terraform.tfvars" file, setting it to your desired region such as `us-west-1`, `eu-west-2`, or `ap-southeast-1`.

    See this [page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) for a list of valid AWS regions.

    Choosing a region close to you can help improve speed and performance.

    **Be sure to click the disk icon above the file to save your change!**

    Once you've set your `region` variable, try running `terraform plan` again. What's different this time?

    Remember that you can set values for any variable declared in your "variables.tf" file in the "terraform.tfvars" file.

  assignment: |-
    Try running the `terraform graph` command:

    ```
    terraform graph
    ```

    This generates code that can be used to create a visual map of your infrastructure. The graph data is in [DOT graph description language format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)). There are several graphing tools you can use to visualize this data, including the free Blast Radius tool. You can learn more about Blast Radius here:

    https://28mm.github.io/blast-radius-docs/

    Start up a Blast Radius server with the following command:

    ```
    blast-radius --serve .
    ```

    Now switch to the **Terraform Graph** tab to view the infrastructure graph. If the web page is blank, you may need to click the refresh icon (which looks like a circular arrow)

    Explore the Terraform graph for your infrastructure. Dependencies are automatically mapped out for you. This graph was generated using the free Blast Radius tool.

    **NOTE:** Due to a known bug you may not be able to drag and zoom the graph. The main point of this exercise is to see how terraform maps out complex infrastructure. So don't worry if your graph doesn't show color.

    Terraform uses this graph to determine which resources can be built in parallel for maximum efficiency.

    Several resource types support AWS's tags. Read the Terraform documentation for the `aws_vpc` resource to learn about the `tags` argument and its format.

    [Terraform Docs: the aws_vpc resource - Click Here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc)

    Add a tag to your VPC resource in the **main.tf** file. The name of the tag should be `environment` and the value should be `Production`. (The tag is case-sensitive. Make sure you use a capital P.)

    Hint: Read the examples carefully! Unlike the other resource arguments you've seen, the value of the `tags` argument must be a **map** (a `{key = "value"}` data structure). Additionally, you must use `=` after `tags` and after `environment`. For more about Terraform's data types, see the [Terraform language documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#types-and-values).

    Now switch to the **Terraform Graph** tab to view the infrastructure graph. If the web page is blank, you may need to click the refresh icon (which looks like a circular arrow)

    Explore the Terraform graph for your infrastructure. Dependencies are automatically mapped out for you. This graph was generated using the free Blast Radius tool.

    **NOTE:** Due to a known bug you may not be able to drag and zoom the graph. The main point of this exercise is to see how terraform maps out complex infrastructure. So don't worry if your graph doesn't show color.

    Terraform uses this graph to determine which resources can be built in parallel for maximum efficiency.

    What happens when you run `terraform apply` without specifying a plan file?
  answers:
  - Terraform runs without any plan
  - Terraform reads the previous plan and then applies it
  - Terraform runs a new plan right before the apply
  - None of the above

    Open the `main.tf` file on the "Code Editor" tab. Scroll down until you find the `remote-exec` provisioner block.

    Add the following two lines at the end of the inline list of commands:

    ```
    "sudo apt -y install cowsay",
    "cowsay Mooooooooooo!",
    ```

    After copying them into your buffer, it will be easier to paste them if you hide the assignment by clicking the ">" icon . Click it again to redisplay the assignment. Be sure to save the file.

    This might be a good time to use the `terraform fmt` command to line up the commands nicely.

    Now apply your changes:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Scroll back through the log output. You should see an ASCII art cow saying "Moooooooo!"

    Variables give the consumers of your Terraform code an easy way to customize their infrastructure.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform variables have five levels of precedence. 1=highest 5=lowest:

      1. Command line flag - run as a command line switch
      1. Configuration file - set in your terraform.tfvars file
      1. Environment variable - part of your shell environment
      1. Default Config - default value in variables.tf
      1. User manual entry - if not specified, prompt the user for entry
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Here are some other fun placeholder sites you can try with the **placeholder** variable:

      placedog.net<br>
      placebear.com<br>
      www.fillmurray.com<br>
      www.placecage.com<br>
      placebeard.it<br>
      loremflickr.com<br>
      baconmockup.com<br>
      placeimg.com<br>
  assignment: |-
    There are several ways to configure Terraform variables. So far we've been using the `terraform.tfvars` file to set our variables. Try re-deploying your application with different **height** and **width** variables on the command line. Reload the webapp after each apply to observe any changes.

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var height=600 -var width=800
    ```

    Next try setting an environment variable that Terraform can read. Run this command to set the placeholder variable:

    ```
    export TF_VAR_placeholder=placedog.net
    ```

    Run another `terraform apply -auto-approve` command:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Now try it again with the same variable set differently on the command line:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var placeholder=placebear.com
    ```

    Which variable took precedence? Why?

    See this [doc](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definition-precedence) if you're unsure.

    HCP Terraform offers unlimited free Terraform state storage for users. Safeguard your state files by storing them remotely in HCP Terraform.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: HCP Terraform remote state storage is free for all users.
  assignment: |-
    During this challenge and the next one, you'll use the remote state feature of HCP Terraform to store your state file in the cloud. In order to do this you'll need a HCP Terraform account. Click on the URL below and sign up for a free account if you don't have one already:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Once you're signed into HCP Terraform create a new organization called YOURNAME-training. Replace YOURNAME with your own name or other text.

    Next you'll be prompted to create a workspace. You can skip the VCS integration step by clicking the "CLI-driven workflow" panel. Name your workspace **hashicat-aws**.

    **Note:** If you already have a **hashicat-aws** workspace, please delete the workspace by selecting the **Settings >> Destruction and Deletion** menu, clicking the "Delete from HCP Terraform" button, typing "hashicat-aws" to confirm, and then clicking the "Delete workspace" button. Then re-create it as above. Doing this avoids possible problems with mis-matched state versions when executing local runs after having executed remote runs. This could happen if you played the [HCP Terraform with AWS](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/hcp-terraform-aws) track and then played this track.

    Run `terraform version` on the "Shell" tab and then set the **Terraform Version** to match on the workspace's **Settings >> General** settings page.

    Also, change the **Execution Mode** to **Local**.

    Be sure to save your settings by clicking the "Save settings" button at the bottom of the page! This will allow us to run Terraform commands from our workstation with local variables, which we'll do in the next challenge.

    The terraform command line tool can store its state in HCP Terraform. All that is required is a user token.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      With *local* execution mode the Terraform commands and variables all remain
      on your workstation.

      With *remote* execution mode Terraform runs in a HCP Terraform
      container environment. All variables must be configured in the cloud environment with this method.
  assignment: |-
    During this challenge we'll configure HCP Terraform as a remote state backend, and then migrate our existing state file to HCP Terraform.

    Edit the "remote_backend.tf" file and replace the YOURORGANIZATION placeholder with your org name. Be sure to save the file.

    Let's generate a new **user token** for use on your workstation. Visit the User Settings > Tokens page in HCP Terraform:

    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens

    Click on the **Create an API token** button. You can name the token whatever you like. Copy the entire token using your mouse or the small copy-paste icon.

    Back in the Instruqt track, you need to add your API token to a file called "credentials.tfrc.json". Select the "Credentials File" tab and open the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file directly.

    Replace the part that says YOURTOKEN with what you copied from HCP Terraform. Be sure to save the file.

    Your token is now safely stored in the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file.

    Now run `terraform init` to migrate your state to HCP Terraform.

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    Type "yes" when it prompts you to migrate your state into HCP Terraform.

    Your state is now safely stored in HCP Terraform. You can verify this on the "States" tab of your workspace in the TFC UI.

    Run a `terraform apply -auto-approve` and watch your state file evolve with each change. You can browse through previous state files with the HCP Terraform UI.

      Terraform can destroy infrastructure as easily as it can build it.

      Use `terraform destroy` with caution.
  assignment: |-
    Run the following command to destroy your infrastructure:

    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```

    You'll need to type "yes" when prompted to destroy your infrastructure. This is a safety feature to help prevent accidental deletion of important resources.

    Wait until the destroy action has completely finished before clicking on the **Check** button.
