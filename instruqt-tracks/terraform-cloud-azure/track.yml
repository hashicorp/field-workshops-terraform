  teaser: |
    Configure your code editor for Terraform and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Welcome to your first day as an intern at ACME Inc. [ACME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m7evoFF83c) is a multi-national conglomerate that sells anvils, rocket powered roller skates, portable holes, earthquake pills and birdseed.

    After employee orientation you sit down at your workstation and open your text editor, Visual Studio Code.

    Open the Code Editor tab on the left. First get familiar with the menus.

    Find the "hamburger" or triple-line menu on the top of the navigation bar on the left. It's right underneath the Instruqt mascot logo. This is your Main Menu. You can find all the other menu options here.

    You should see some files in the explorer bar on the left side menu. These are terraform config files for the hashicat application.

    Next you should install the Terraform extension to enable syntax highlighting in your code. Click on the extensions icon - it looks like four small boxes.

    Search for **Terraform** and be sure to select the "Terraform 1.4.x" extension from mauve. **Do not select the "HashiCorp Terraform 2.x.y" extension** since it will not work in the version of the the Visual Studio Code Server that this track is using. Click the green **Install** button to install the extension. Then click the **Reload Required** button to activate it.

    We have enabled auto-save in your Code Editor, so any changes you make will be saved as you type. You don't have to worry about saving files manually.

    **Please execute all commands on the "Shell" tab.** While the Code Editor allows you to open a terminal window inside it, it is not currently possible to paste `terraform` commands from the assignment into it within Instruqt.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform on Azure. We'll use the hashicat-azure example app in the rest of the challenges as you learn new Terraform skills.

    Click the **Check** button to continue.

    Terraform Cloud offers unlimited free Terraform state storage for users. Safeguard your state files by storing them remotely in Terraform Cloud.
  assignment: |-
    Sign up for a free Terraform Cloud account at the following URL:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Once you're signed into Terraform Cloud, you'll see a screen with several options. Please click the "Not right now, skip questions" link and confirm that you want to skip the questions. Then create a new organization called YOURNAME-training. Replace YOURNAME with your own name or other text.

    Next you'll be prompted to create a workspace. Select the "CLI-driven workflow" panel, type **hashicap-azure**, and click the "Create workspace" button.

    No really...you *must* name your workspace **hashicat-azure**. If you don't the exercises will break. Do not attempt to name it something else.

    DO NOT SKIP THIS NEXT STEP:

    Go into the workspace's **Settings >> General** settings page and change the **Execution Mode** to local.

    Be sure to save your settings! This will allow us to run Terraform commands from our workstation with local variables.

    Enable a free trial of Terraform Cloud paid features by navigating to: **Settings** > **Plan & Billing**, select **Trial Plan**, and click the button for **Start your free trial**.

    Or, if you have an existing account where you've already used a trial, provide your instructor with your organization's name. They will upgrade your organization to unlock a 30 day free trial of all paid features.

    Before you click the **Check** button, did you change your Execution Mode to Local? This is an easy step to miss so we mention it twice.

  title: "\U0001F4D2 Safekeeping Your Terraform State"
  teaser: |
    An unexpected outage has taken down one of the production websites. It took longer than expected to recover because the Terraform state file was stored on someone's laptop. Terraform Cloud's remote state feature is here to help.
  assignment: |-
    Your task is to configure remote state using your Terraform Cloud account. In order to complete this challenge you'll need the following:

    1. A free Terraform Cloud account - log in at https://app.terraform.io<br>
    2. An organization called **yourname-training**. You just created this in the previous exercise.<br>
    3. A workspace named **hashicat-azure** with its Execution Mode set to **Local** (not Remote)<br>
    4. A *user* token for authentication<br>
    5. A `remote_backend` config stored in your workspace<br>

    Let's generate a new **user token** for use on your workstation. Visit the User Settings > Tokens page in Terraform Cloud:

    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens

    Click on the **Create an API token** button. You can name the token whatever you like. Copy the entire token using your mouse or the small copy-paste icon.

    Next, go back to your Instruqt workstation code editor and open the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file. Replace the part that says YOURTOKEN with what you copied from Terraform Cloud. Close the file.

    Your token is now safely stored in the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file.

    Return to your Code Editor tab and edit the `remote_backend.tf` file, replacing the YOURORGANIZATION and YOURWORKSPACE placeholders with your org name and workspace name. Save the file.

    We've created a **terraform.tfvars** file for you to edit.

    Open the **terraform.tfvars** file and set your prefix variable by replacing "yourname" with your own name. However, to ensure uniqueness within Azure, we recommend you use your first and last names with or without a hyphen between them.

    **Keep your prefix string all lower case, and between 5-12 characters long. Do not use an underscore in your prefix.**

    The prefix will become part of your application hostname, and therefore must be DNS-compliant. Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7) letters from a to z, the digits from 0 to 9, and the hyphen (-).  A hostname may not start with a hyphen.

    Once you've got all the pieces in place, try running a `terraform init` and then `terraform apply` command on the "Shell" tab.

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

    Remember to type *yes* on the "Shell" tab when you are prompted by Terraform to confirm the apply.

    When the `terraform apply` finishes, you should see output like this:
    ```
    Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    catapp_url = http://sean-carolan-meow.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com
    ```
    Please click on the URL to test that your application is working. If it won't load, please run the `terraform apply` command again. That usually fixes this problem.

    Additionally, you should see a new state file on the "States" tab of your Terraform Cloud workspace.

    Note: If you ran terraform locally before configuring the remote backend, you might have a local state file called `terraform.tfstate`. If so, please delete it by running `rm terraform.tfstate`.

    Report back to Robin with the *Check* button below once you've successfully deployed the hashicat application with remote state enabled.

    If you'd like to see the hashicat application in your web browser, simply copy the link from the output of your Terraform run, and paste it into the URL bar in another tab or window.

  title: "\U0001F510 Securing Cloud Credentials"
  teaser: |
    Your team has started building cloud infrastructure on Azure, but the security team is concerned about protecting access to everyone's cloud credentials.
  assignment: |-
    After the Azure credentials issue, the security team is tightening down access to your Azure account. API keys must now be secured as stored variables in Terraform Cloud. Your task is to find your Azure credentials, and move them into your workspace as secure environment variables.

    In order to complete this challenge you'll need to do the following:

    1. Find your Azure credentials with the following command:
    ```
    env | grep ARM
    ```
    2. The four environment variables you need are `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, and `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.
    3. Update the **Execution Mode** settings in your workspace to **Remote**.
    4. Change the **Apply Method** to Auto apply. This will save you the trouble of having to approve every Terraform run manually. Remember to click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page!
    5. Set **Environment Variables** for your Azure credentials and mark the **ARM_CLIENT_SECRET** as **Sensitive**. The other three environment variables may remain in plaintext.
    6. Set **Terraform Variables** for your `prefix` and `location`. Learn more about these variables by looking in the variables.tf file. NOTE: You *must* configure these variables on the remote workspace, as they will no longer be read from your local terraform.tfvars file.

    Test your work by running `terraform init`. Your backend configuration will be updated for remote execution.

    Next try running `terraform plan`. This will trigger what's known as a speculative plan. You can view this plan by copying the link from your "Shell" tab.  This plan will not show up in your ordinary terraform runs that are triggered via the UI or API.

    A copy of the plan output will be streamed back to your "Shell" tab. Run a terraform apply to see it in action. The apply will show up if you navigate to the runs page in the Terraform Cloud UI.

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    Congratulations, your Azure keys are now safely encrypted and stored in your Terraform Cloud workspace.

    You can continue to run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` in your "Shell" tab, but the execution is now done in Terraform Cloud.

  teaser: |
    As your Terraform usage increases more team members want to collaborate. Let's add some teams and access rules for our organization.
  assignment: |-
    Teams and role-based access controls are a paid feature of Terraform Cloud. You will need to ensure your free trial has been activated from the earlier steps in order to complete this challenge.

    In this challenge you'll create teams with different levels of access to your workspace. You can then invite other users to collaborate on code changes, approvals, and Terraform runs.

    1. Go into your organization's General Settings and click on the **Teams** link.<br>
    2. Add a team called **admins**. Admins should be able to manage policies, manage workspaces, and manage VCS settings. Be sure to click the "Update team organization access" button after checking all 3 checkboxes.<br>
    3. Add another team called **developers**. Developers should not have any organization-wide access.<br>
    4. Add a third team called **managers**. Managers should also not have any organization-wide access.

    Next, assign access rights to the hashicat-azure workspace. Go into the **Team Access** page of the hashicat-azure workspace settings. If you don't see the Team Access link you might need to log out and back into Terraform Cloud.

    You'll want to click the "Add team and permissions" button and then click the "Select team" button next to each team to which you wish to grant workspace access. Then click the "Assign permissions" button for the desired permission.

    * Give the **admins** group admin level access.<br>
    * Give the **developers** group write level access.<br>
    * Give the **managers** group read level access.

    Now that you have created teams and given them workspace access you can invite some users to your organization. Return to your **General Settings** for the organization, and select **Users**. Then click the "Invite a user" button.

    If you're doing an instructor-led training, you can invite your instructor or a fellow student to your organization and place them on the developers team. You'll need the email address attached to their Terraform Cloud account to invite them.

    Or you can use one of our example users below:

    * `workshops+aisha@hashicorp.com`
    * `workshops+lars@hashicorp.com`
    * `workshops+hiro@hashicorp.com`

    Note that you will not see any users in your organization until they accept your invitations.

    You will need at least two users (including yourself) in your organization to pass this challenge. The users you invite do not have to accept the invite to be counted.

    The team has grown and you need to implement code reviews. Terraform Cloud can connect to popular Version Control Systems to enable collaboration and testing.
  assignment: |-
    In order for different teams and indivdiuals to be able to work on the same Terraform code, you need to use a Version Control System (VCS). Terraform Cloud can integrate with the most popular VCS systems including GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

    You will need a free GitHub.com account for this challenge. We recommend using a personal account for training instead your work account (if you have one).

    In this challenge your first task is to create a fork of the hashicat-azure repository. Visit this URL and click on the **Fork** button in the upper right corner to create your own copy of the repo.

    https://github.com/hashicorp/hashicat-azure

    Run the following commands to update your git configuration for your own repository. Don't forget to replace YOURGITUSER with your own git username in the second command.

    ```
    git remote remove origin
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURGITUSER/hashicat-azure
    ```

    Also run these commands:

    ```
    git pull
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
    git config --global core.editor "vi"
    ```

    Next use these commands to set your email and name:
    ```
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    ```

    ```
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```

    To complete your `git` operations, please commit and push your modified remote_backend.tf file with these commands on your "Shell" tab:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "adding remote backend"
    git push origin master
    ```

    Note that you'll have to provide your GitHub username and password or personal access token in order to complete the `git push` command.

    If you have two-factor authentication enabled and don't remember your personal access token,  you'll need to create a new one. To do that, log onto GitHub and visit the Tokens page:

    https://github.com/settings/tokens

    Then click on **Personal Access Tokens** and generate a new token for the workshop. You can delete it afterwards if you like. This token enables you to push changes from your workstation.

    Now that you have your own copy of the hashicat-azure repo to work with, follow the **Configuring GitHub Access** section of the TFC documentation to connect your GitHub account to your Terraform Organization.

    https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/github.html

    Once you've configured GitHub access for your workspace, you can update your workspace to use your hashicat-azure repository as the source for all Terraform runs. Go into the **Settings > Version Control** settings page for your workspace. Connect your workspace to the fork of your hashicat-azure repository on GitHub. You can leave all the VCS settings at their defaults.

    The first VCS-backed apply should trigger immediately. Click on the Runs tab to view the run in action.

    Congratulations, all Terraform changes must now go through version control before they are used in your workspace. This enables you to do code reviews before any changes are pushed to production. It also provides a valuable record of any and all changes made to the code that built your infrastructure. This can prevent configuration drift and undocumented changes.

    Click the **Check** button to let Jane know she can clone the hashicat-azure repo for QA testing.

  assignment: |-
    In this challenge you'll make a small change to the code that deploys the hashicat-azure application, and then create a "Pull Request", which is simply a way of proposing a change and optionally allowing others to review your changes.

    Find a partner, or if you're alone you can do this exercise solo. Exchange github usernames and browse to the other person's **fork** of the hashicat-azure repository. For example:

    https://github.com/YOURNAME/hashicat-azure

    **Please do NOT issue your pull request against the hashicorp/hashicat-azure repository!**

    Browse to the `files/deploy_app.sh` file and click on the small pencil icon in the upper right corner of the text area. This will allow you to edit the file right in your browser.

    Replace the following text with your own catchy marketing slogan for ACME.

    ```
    Welcome to ${PREFIX}'s app. Replace this text with your own.

    You'll notice that a check is run against your Terraform Cloud workspace. If you right-click the "Details" link of the check and then open the link in a new tab, you'll see the speculative plan that has been run in your workspace.

    However, be sure to close that new browser tab if you open it since the GitHub check being run against Terraform Cloud will not be marked as complete until you do.

    Your partner should now review and approve the pull request. Or, if you're working alone you can review your own pull request and merge the changes.

    Once you've merged your changes to the master branch, watch the Terraform run that starts in the Terraform Cloud UI.

  title: "\U0001F6E1️ Terraform Compliance with Sentinel"
  teaser: |
    Developers in your organization are building cloud resources without tagging them properly. You need a way to enforce tagging on all your Azure instances that are built with Terraform. Meet Sentinel, the governance engine for Terraform.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge you'll use Sentinel to enforce a rule that requires any Azure Virtual Machine created in your account to have the correct billable and department tags.

    ### Challenge Setup

    1. Create a fork of the following GitHub repo, which contains a Sentinel Policy Set that you can use in your own organization. As you did with the hashicat-azure repo, use the **Fork** button in the upper right corner of the screen to create your own copy.

    https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-workshops-sentinel

    Before moving on, please look at the [enforce-mandatory-tags](https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-workshops-sentinel/blob/master/azure/enforce-mandatory-tags.sentinel) policy. This policy requires all Azure VMs to have `Department` and `Billable` tags. It uses some functions from a Sentinel module in a different repository called [terraform-guides](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides). You'll find many useful Sentinel policies and functions in its [governance/third-generation](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-guides/tree/master/governance/third-generation) directory.

    2. Go into the **Organization Settings** for your training organization and click on **Policy Sets**.

    3. Use the **Connect a new policy set** button to connect your new GitHub repo to your organization. Remember, the repository is named **tfc-workshops-sentinel**.

    4. Under **Description** you can enter "Sentinel Policies for our Azure resources".

    5. In the **More Options** menu set the **Policies Path** to `/azure`. This tells Terraform Cloud to use the Azure specific policies that are stored in the repo.

    6. Leave everything else at its default setting and click on the **Connect Policy Set** button at the bottom of the page.

    You are now ready to begin the challenge.

    ### The Challenge

    First, add the **Department** tag with a value of "devops" to the azurerm_virtual_machine resource in your main.tf file.

    Then run the following commands to push the change to your forked repository:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added the first tag"
    git push origin master
    ```

    These commands mean "Pull any remote changes, add all my changes, commit them to the local git repo, then push them to the master branch of the remote repo." Note that you will have to provide your GitHub credentinals for the `git push` command.

    If you're prompted to do a `git pull` by the `push` in order to incorporate remote changes, you'll need to run `git pull`. This will display a document in the `vi` text editor with a merge message. Simply type `:wq` to save the file. Then run `git status` to see if any files changed. Then check the changed files to make sure they are correct. Then repeat the `git push origin master` command.

    A plan that successfully runs will be followed by a Sentinel policy check against the enforce-mandatory-tags.sentinel policy. This policy will fail because you have (intentionally) not yet added the **Billable** tag to your azurerm_virtual_machine resource. As a consequence, you will not be able to apply the run.

    Now, add the **Billable** tag to the azurerm_virtual machine resource in your main.tf file with a value of "true" and then run these commands to push the change to your repository:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added the second tag"
    git push origin master
    ```

    This time, the Sentinel policy should pass because your Azure VM now has both tags.

    Each time you push a change to master, you'll trigger a new Terraform run. Keep trying until you pass the Sentinel policy check.

  title: "\U0001F4DA Private Module Registry"
  teaser: |
    Some of your users want a simple way to deploy databases and network configurations. Enter the Private Module Registry, where you can store standard, re-usable Terraform configurations that others can use in their own workspaces.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge you'll learn to use the Private Module Registry, which allows you to store and version re-usable snippets of Terraform code. Think of modules like custom resources for your own environment.

    Instead of writing this module from scratch you can copy the existing Azure network module from the public Terraform registry. Visit this URL to view the Azure Network module:

    https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/network/azurerm/2.0.0

    Note the **Source Code** link that points at the GitHub repository for this module. Click on the Source URL. As you did in previous challenges, create your own fork of this repository with the **Fork** button.

    Back in the Terraform Cloud control panel, click on the **Modules** link at the top of the page. Click on the **+Add Module** button. Click on the Github button and select the terraform-azurerm-vnet module that you just forked.

    Click on **Publish Module**.

    Create a new Terraform file called `vnet.tf` in the hashicat-azure directory and use the module in this file to create a new Virtual Network for Gaurav. You can copy the module creation code from the "Provision Instructions" section of the module's page in your Private Module Registry.

    You'll also have to add the required variables listed on the Inputs tab of the module. For inputs that reference resources already created in your main.tf file, we recommend that you use references that refer to the appropriate attributes of those resources. But you could also use hard-coded values after finding them in your current state file.

    HINT: The docs in the GitHub source of the module are your friend. They might even have an example of how the code should look.

    After you have saved the `vnet.tf` file, commit it to your local git repository and push the changes to your remote fork. You'll need to run a `git pull` command first to pull in the changes you made in the previous collaboration challenge.

    ```
    git pull
    ```
    The pull command will pop open the `vi` text editor with a merge message. Simply type `:wq` to save the file and complete the merge.

    Next you can add, commit, and push your latest changes to your remote fork. You will be prompted to log onto your github account to push the change.

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added vnet module"
    git push origin master
    ```

    If all went well you should see a new network being built in the console output. Wait until your terraform apply command is complete, then click the `Check` button to verify your work.

  teaser: |
    Terraform Cloud has a fully featured RESTful API that you can use to integrate with external systems. Where we're going, we don't need a GUI!
  assignment: |-
    In the final challenge you'll directly interact with the Terraform Cloud API. Terraform Cloud has a rich API that lets you do everything you can do in the GUI and more. Intermediate and advanced users utilize the API to create complex integrations that work with external systems.

    Your goal is to configure three variables in the hashicat-azure workspace and then trigger a Terraform run using only the API. The three variables you need to configure are:
    - `placeholder` An image placeholder URL. Examples: placekitten.com, placedog.net, picsum.photos
    - `height` The height in pixels for your image. Set this to 600
    - `width` The width in pixels for your image. Set this to 800
    If you've already configured any of the three variables in the UI please delete them before starting the challenge.
    ### Challenge Setup:
    Run this command to fetch your token and store it as the TOKEN environment variable:
    ```
    export TOKEN=$(grep token /root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json | cut -d '"' -f4)
    ```
    Next set your ORG variable with the following command, replacing MYORGNAME with your own:
    ```
    export ORG="MYORGNAME"
    ```
    Finally, fetch your workspace id with the following curl command. Curl is a command line tool that is handy for interacting directly with APIs. Note how your TOKEN and ORG variables are automatically embedded in the command:
    ```
    curl -s --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json"   https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces/hashicat-azure | jq -r .data.id
    ```
    Copy or save this workspace ID somewhere as you will need it during the challenge.
    ### The Challenge:
    Use the four *.json files located in the json directory to update your variables and trigger a Terraform plan/apply. Use the Terraform API docs to determine which commands to run. You can edit the files in your text editor to customize them for your workspace.

    HINT: The global find-and-replace (magnifying glass icon) allows you to replace text across all the files in your workspace at once.

    When you've succesfully triggered a run via the API with the new variables, click the Check button to continue.
