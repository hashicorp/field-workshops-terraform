Welcome to your first day as an intern at ACME Inc. [ACME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m7evoFF83c) is a multi-national conglomerate that sells anvils, rocket powered roller skates, portable holes, earthquake pills and birdseed.

After employee orientation you sit down at your workstation and open your Code Editor.

Click on the **Code Editor** tab now. This is where you'll be editing and writing Terraform code. Open the file called **README.md** by clicking on it in the FILES menu on the left. Add your name at the bottom of the file.

See the floppy disk icon on the tab? It looks like this: üíæ. Click on the floppy disk icon to save the file.

Next have a look at your **Shell** tab. This is where you'll be running all your terraform commands.

Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform on AWS. We'll use the hashicat-aws example app in the rest of the challenges as you learn new Terraform skills.

Click the **Check** button to continue.
