After the AWS credentials issue, the security team is tightening down access to your AWS account. API creds must now be secured as stored variables in Terraform Cloud. Your task is to find your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, and move them into your workspace as secure environment variables.

You'll store the Access Key ID as a plain text environment variable, and the Secret Access Key as a sensitive environment variable. You may also enter optional descriptions for each variable but this is not required to complete the challenge.

In order to complete this challenge you'll need to do the following:

1. Find your AWS credentials with the following commands:

```
echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
2. Update the **Execution Mode** settings in your workspace to **Remote** on the Settings > General tab.
3. Change the **Apply Method** to "Auto apply" on the same page. This will save you the trouble of having to approve every Terraform run manually. Remember to click the **Save settings** button at the bottom of the page!
4. Set **Environment Variables** for your AWS credentials on the Variables tab. Store the *AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID* as a regular environment variable, but mark the *AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY* as sensitive.
5. Set **Terraform Variables** for your `prefix` and `region`. Learn more about these variables by looking in the variables.tf file. Set the same values you used in your terraform.tfvars file to avoid all the resources being destroyed and re-created (unless you like waiting longer). NOTE: You *must* configure these variables on the remote workspace, as they will no longer be read from your local terraform.tfvars file.
6. This code has been tested in the **us-east-1** region. Note that there are some regions that do not support the t2.micro instance type. If you encounter this, switch your region to us-east-1.

Test your work by running `terraform init`. Your backend configuration will be updated for remote execution.

Next try running `terraform plan`. This will trigger what's known as a speculative plan. You can view this plan by copying the link from your "Shell" tab. This plan will not show up in your ordinary terraform runs that are triggered via the UI or API. A copy of the plan output will be streamed back to your "Shell" tab.

Run a terraform apply. This apply **will** show up if you navigate to the runs page in the Terraform Cloud UI.

```
terraform apply
```

Congratulations, your AWS keys are now safely encrypted and stored in your Terraform Cloud workspace.

You can continue to run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` in your "Shell" tab, but the execution is now done in Terraform Cloud.
