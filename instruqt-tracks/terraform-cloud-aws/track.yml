  teaser: Configure your code editor for Terraform and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Welcome to your first day as an intern at ACME Inc. [ACME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m7evoFF83c) is a multi-national conglomerate that sells anvils, rocket powered roller skates, portable holes, earthquake pills and birdseed.

    After employee orientation you sit down at your workstation and open your text editor, Visual Studio Code.

    Open the Code Editor tab on the left. First get familiar with the menus.

    Find the "hamburger" or triple-line menu on the top of the navigation bar on the left. It's right underneath the Instruqt mascot logo. This is your Main Menu. You can find all the other menu options here.

    Right below the Main Menu you'll see a column of icons. The first icon looks like a stack of documents. This is the File Explorer. Click on the File Explorer icon then select **Open Folder**.

    Select the `hashicat-aws` directory and hit `OK`.

    Next, enable the Terraform Language Server for syntax highlighting and other features. Click on the Main Menu and select **View >> Command Palette**, then type in `Terraform`.

    Select the option that says **Terraform: Install/Update Language Server**. Install the latest version of the language server from the list. Open the command palette again and select **Terraform: Enable/Disable Language Server**.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform on AWS. We'll use the hashicat-aws example app in the rest of the challenges as you learn new Terraform skills.

    Click the **Check** button to continue.

  assignment: |-
    Click on the Main Menu and select **Terminal > New Terminal** or use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL-J** (**CMD-J** on Mac).

    All Terraform commands should be run from the terminal within the Code Editor.

    Try the **CTRL-J** shortcut to toggle the terminal window open and closed. If you don't see a command prompt in the terminal pane, simply click on the trash can icon and open a new terminal.

    You can use the little caret ^ shaped button on the terminal pane to expand and shrink your Terminal window. This is useful for viewing logs.

    Click on the File Explorer icon a couple times to toggle the File Explorer on and off. This can provide more space while you're viewing and editing code.

    You can also hide and show these notes with the expand icon on the upper right side of the GUI. It looks like a box with two small arrows in the corners. This will expand and close the notes panel. Try it now to give your text editor more space.

    NOTE: If you prefer a classic command line experience we've provided another tab titled **Terminal**. The vim text editor is also installed on your workstation.

    Good job, you're ready to deploy the hashicat application on AWS!

    Safeguard your state files by storing them remotely in Terraform Cloud.
  assignment: |-
    Sign up for a free Terraform Cloud account at the following URL:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Once you're signed into Terraform Cloud create a new organization called YOURNAME-training. Replace YOURNAME with your own name or other text.

    Next you'll be prompted to create a workspace. You can skip the VCS integration step by clicking the "No VCS Connection" button. Name your workspace **hashicat-aws**.

    Now go into the workspace's **Settings >> General** settings page and change the Execution Mode to local.  Be sure to save your settings! This will allow us to run Terraform commands from our workstation with local variables.

    Finally, provide your instructor with your organization's name. They will upgrade your organization to unlock a 30 day free trial of all paid features.

  teaser: An unexpected outage has taken down one of the production websites. It took
    longer than expected to recover because the Terraform state file was stored on
    someone's laptop. Terraform Cloud's remote state feature is here to help.
  assignment: |-
    Your task is to configure remote state using your Terraform Cloud account. In order to complete this challenge you'll need the following:

    1. A free Terraform Cloud account - log in at https://app.terraform.io<br>
    2. An organization called **yourname-training**. You just created this in the previous exercise.<br>
    3. A workspace named **hashicat-aws** with its Execution Mode set to **Local** (not Remote)<br>
    4. A *user* token for authentication<br>
    5. A `.terraformrc` file to store your user token<br>
    6. A `remote_backend` config stored in your workspace<br>

    We've given you a head start with templates for the `/root/.terraformrc` file and your `remote_backend.tf` configuration file. You will need to edit these files and insert your own token, organization and
    workspace names.

    Please do not delete either of these files as they are required to complete the track successfully.

    Once you've got all the pieces in place, try running a `terraform init` and then `terraform apply` command in the terminal.

    When you're done you should see a new state file in your Terraform Cloud workspace.

    Report back to Robin with the *Check* button below once you've successfully deployed the hashicat application with remote state enabled.

  title: "\U0001F510 Securing Cloud Credentials"
  teaser: Your team has started building cloud infrastructure on AWS, but the security
    team is concerned about protecting access to everyone's cloud credentials.
  assignment: |-
    After the AWS credentials issue, the security team is tightening down access to your AWS account. API keys must now be secured as stored variables in Terraform Cloud. Your task is to find your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, and move them into your workspace as secure environment variables.

    In order to complete this challenge you'll need to do the following:

    1. Find your AWS credentials with the following commands:

    ```
    echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```
    2. Update the **Execution Mode** settings in your workspace to **Remote**.
    3. Change the **Apply Method** to Auto apply. This will save you the trouble of having to approve every Terraform run manually. Remember to click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page!
    4. Set **Environment Variables** for your AWS credentials and mark them as **Sensitive**.
    5. Set **Terraform Variables** for your `prefix` and `region`. Learn more about these variables by looking in the variables.tf file.

    Test your work by running `terraform init`. Your backend configuration will be updated for remote execution.

    Next try running `terraform plan`. You should see a remote execution run begin on Terraform Cloud. A copy of the output will be streamed back to your terminal. Run a terraform apply to see it in action:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    The `-auto-approve` flag will override the approval phase and go directly to the build.

    Congratulations, your AWS keys are now safely encrypted and stored in your Terraform Cloud workspace.

    You can continue to run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` in your terminal, but the execution is now done in Terraform Cloud.

  teaser: As your Terraform usage increases more team members want to collaborate.
    Let's add some teams and access rules for our organization.
  assignment: |-
    Teams and role-based access controls are a paid feature of Terraform Cloud. Your instructor will need to upgrade your organization to a free trial in order to complete this challenge.

    In this challenge you'll create teams with different levels of access to your workspace. You can then invite other users to collaborate on code changes, approvals, and Terraform runs.

    1. Go into your organization's General Settings and click on the **Teams** link.<br>
    2. Add a team called **admins**. Admins should be able to manage policies, manage workspaces, and manage VCS settings.<br>
    3. Add another team called **developers**. Developers should not have any organization-wide access.<br>
    4. Add a third team called **managers**. Managers should also not have any organization-wide access.

    Next, assign access rights to the hashicat-aws workspace. Go into the **Team Access** page of the hashicat-aws workspace settings.

    * Give the **admins** group admin level access.<br>
    * Give the **developers** group write level access.<br>
    * Give the **managers** group read level access.

    Now that you have created teams you can invite some users to your organization.

    If you're doing an instructor-led training, you can invite your instructor or a fellow student to your organization and place them on the developers team. You'll need the email address attached to their Terraform Cloud account to invite them.

    Or you can use one of our example users below:

    * `workshops+aisha@hashicorp.com`
    * `workshops+lars@hashicorp.com`
    * `workshops+hiro@hashicorp.com`

    Note that you will not see any users in your organization until they accept your invitations.

    You will need at least two users in your organization to pass this challenge.

    can connect to popular Version Control Systems to enable collaboration and testing.
  assignment: |-
    In order for different teams and indivdiuals to be able to work on the same Terraform code, you need to use a Version Control System (VCS). Terraform Cloud can integrate with the most popular VCS systems including GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

    You will need a free GitHub.com account for this challenge. We recommend using a personal account for training instead your work account (if you have one).

    In this challenge your first task is to create a fork of the hashicat-aws repository. Visit this URL and click on the **Fork** button in the upper right corner to create your own copy of the repo.

    https://github.com/hashicorp/hashicat-aws

    Run the following commands to update your git configuration for your own repository. Don't forget to replace YOURGITUSER with your own git username.

    ```
    git remote remove origin
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURGITUSER/hashicat-aws
    ```

    Next use these commands to set your email and name:
    ```
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    ```

    ```
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```

    Now that you have your own copy of the hashicat-aws repo to work with, follow the **Configuring GitHub Access** section of the TFC documentation to connect your GitHub account to your Terraform Organization.

    https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/github.html

    Once you've configured GitHub access, you can update your workspace to use your hashicat-aws repository as the source for all Terraform runs. Go into the **Settings > Version Control** settings page for your workspace. Connect your workspace to the fork of your hashicat-aws repository on GitHub. You can leave all the VCS settings at their defaults.

    The first VCS-backed apply should trigger immediately. Click on the Runs tab to view the run in action.

    Congratulations, all Terraform changes must now go through version control before they are used in your workspace. This enables you to do code reviews before any changes are pushed to production. It also provides a valuable record of any and all changes made to the code that built your infrastructure. This can prevent configuration drift and undocumented changes.

    Click the **Check** button to let Jane know she can clone the hashicat-aws repo for QA testing.

    In this challenge you'll make a small change to the code that deploys the hashicat-aws application, and then create a "Pull Request", which is simply a way of proposing a change and optionally allowing others to review your changes.

    Find a partner, or if you're alone you can do this exercise solo. Exchange github usernames and browse to the other person's fork of the hashicat-aws repository. For example:

    https://github.com/YOURNAME/hashicat-aws

    Browse to the `files/deploy_app.sh` file and click on the small pencil icon in the upper right corner of the text area. This will allow you to edit the file right in your browser.

    Replace the following text with your own catchy marketing slogan for ACME.

    ```
    Welcome to ${PREFIX}'s app. Replace this text with your own.
    ```

    Finally at the bottom of the screen, select the option that says "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."

    Your partner should now review and approve the pull request. Or if you're working alone you can review your own pull request and merge the changes.

  title: "\U0001F6E1️ Terraform Compliance with Sentinel"
  teaser: Developers in your organization are building cloud resources without tagging
    them properly. You need a way to enforce tagging on all your AWS instances that
    are built with Terraform. Meet Sentinel, the compliance and security rules engine
    for Terraform.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge you'll use Sentinel to enforce a rule that requires any AWS instance created in your account to have the correct billable and department tags.

    ### Challenge Setup
    1. Before configuring Sentinel you'll need to queue up a Destroy run. You must create a special environment variable named `CONFIRM_DESTROY` in your workspace to enable this. Set the value of this environment variable to `1`. Now you can use the **Settings >> Destruction and Deletion** menu to queue a destroy plan. Do not click the red **Delete from Terraform Cloud** button!!! Instead, click on **Queue Destroy Plan** and confirm it if necessary.

    2. Create a fork of the following GitHub repo, which contains a Sentinel Policy Set that you can use in your own organization. As you did with the hashicat-aws repo, use the **Fork** button in the upper right corner of the screen to create your own copy.

    https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-workshops-sentinel

    3. Go into the **Organization Settings** for your training organization and click on **Policy Sets**.

    4. Use the **Connect a new policy set** button to connect your new GitHub repo to your organization. Remember, the repository is named **tfc-workshops-sentinel**.

    5. Under **Description** you can enter "Sentinel Policies for our AWS resources".

    6. In the **More Options** menu set the **Policies Path** to `/aws`. This tells Terraform Cloud to use the AWS specific policies that are stored in the repo.

    6. Leave everything else at its default setting and click on the **Connect Policy Set** button at the bottom of the page.

    You are now ready to begin the challenge.

    ### The Challenge

    Update your code so that any `aws_instance` resources are properly tagged with the **Billable** and **Department** tags. You can set the Billable tag to "true" and the Department tag to "devops".

    If you need a git refresher, here are the commands you'll need to push a change to your forked repo:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated my code."
    git push origin master
    ```

    These commands mean "Stage all my changes, commit them to the local git repo, then push them to the master branch of the remote repo."

    Each time you push a change to master, you'll trigger a new Terraform run. Keep trying until you pass the Sentinel policy check.

  title: "\U0001F4DA Private Module Registry"
  teaser: Some of your users want a simple way to deploy databases and network configurations.
    Enter the Private Module Registry, where you can store standard, re-usable Terraform
    configurations that others can use in their own workspaces.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge you'll learn to use the Private Module Registry, which allows you to store and version re-usable snippets of Terraform code. Think of modules like custom resources for your own environment.

    Instead of writing this module from scratch you can copy the existing vpc module from the public Terraform registry. Visit this URL to view the VPC module:

    https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws

    Note the **Source:** link that points at the github repository for this module. Click on the Source URL. As you did in previous challenges, create your own fork of this repository with the **Fork** button.

    Back in the Terraform Cloud control panel, click on the **Modules** link at the top of the page. Click on the **+Add Module** button. Click on the Github button and select the terraform-aws-vpc module that you just forked.

    Click on **Publish Module**.

    Create a new Terraform file called `vpc.tf` and use the module in this file to create a new VPC for Gaurav.

    After you have saved the `vpc.tf` file, commit it to your local git repository and push the changes to your remote fork. You will be prompted to log onto your github account to push the change.

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added VPC module"
    git push origin master
    ```

    HINT: The docs are your friend. They might even have an example of how the code should look.

    If all went well you should see a new VPC being built in the console output. Click the `Check` button to verify your work.

  title: "\U0001F517 API Driven Workflows"
  teaser: Terraform Cloud has a fully featured RESTful API that you can use to integrate
    with external systems. Where we're going, we don't need a GUI!
  assignment: |-
    In the final challenge you'll directly interact with the Terraform Cloud API. Terraform Cloud has a rich API that lets you do everything you can do in the GUI and more. Intermediate and advanced users utilize the API to create complex integrations that work with external systems.

    Your goal is to configure three variables in the hashicat-aws workspace and then trigger a Terraform run using only the API. The three variables you need to configure are:
    - `placeholder` An image placeholder URL. Examples: placekitten.com, placedog.net, picsum.photos
    - `height` The height in pixels for your image. Set this to 600
    - `width` The width in pixels for your image. Set this to 800
    If you've already configured any of the three variables in the UI please delete them before starting the challenge.
    ### Challenge Setup:
    Run this command to fetch your token and store it as the TOKEN environment variable:
    ```
    export TOKEN=$(grep token /root/.terraformrc | cut -d '"' -f2)
    ```
    Next set your ORG variable with the following command, replacing MYORGNAME with your own:
    ```
    export ORG="MYORGNAME"
    ```
    Finally, fetch your workspace id with the following curl command. Curl is a command line tool that is handy for interacting directly with APIs. Note how your TOKEN and ORG variables are automatically embedded in the command:
    ```
    curl -s --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json"   https://app.terraform.io/api/v2/organizations/$ORG/workspaces/hashicat-aws | jq -r .data.id
    ```
    Copy or save this workspace ID somewhere as you will need it during the challenge.
    ### The Challenge:
    Use the four *.json files located in the json directory to update your variables and trigger a Terraform plan/apply. Use the Terraform API docs to determine which commands to run. You can edit the files in your text editor to customize them for your workspace.

    HINT: The global find-and-replace (magnifying glass icon) allows you to replace text across all the files in your workspace at once.

    When you've succesfully triggered a run via the API with the new variables, click the Check button to continue.
