title: Workspace Variables and Securing Cloud Credentials
teaser: |
  The security team is concerned about protecting access to Cloud credentials. Create global variable sets, deployment variables and store them securely in Terraform Cloud.

    At ACME, when Terraform runs on individual workstations, sometimes application updates deploy to the wrong region and deployment tests fail. Operators use their local Cloud region when trying to push a new version to prod and use their own Cloud credentials. Occasionally, personal Cloud credentials are accidentally pushed to a public code repository.

    You get the following request from William, the lead infosec admin at ACME:

    > Can you set the Terraform Cloud Organization to manage sensitive Cloud Principal credentials? Once that is done, we can rotate those items regularly, and we can remove any hard-coded Cloud credentials from our deployments.

    Thousands of API and cryptographic keys and secrets are leaking on GitHub every day!

    When you store your API keys as sensitive variables, they are encrypted and stored in the Terraform Cloud platform. These keys are only decrypted in trusted, secure containers that run Terraform commands.

The security team is looking to mitigate the exposure of Cloud credentials.

- The first task is to store Google Cloud Client ID, Client Secret, Subscrition ID and Tenant ID as shared resources with Variable Sets.

- The second task is to set up the non-sensitive, deployment-specific variables for the `hashicat-gcp` application with Workspace Variables.

---
- The utility code for Terraform Cloud is pre-configured with examples for Variable Sets and Workspace Variables.

- In the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab, update your Terraform Cloud resources with Variable Sets and Workspace Variables:

```bash
cd /root/terraform-cloud

# 1. Create global variable set with Cloud
#    credentials marked as sensitive
# 2. Load workspace variables
# 3. Set workspace to remote execution
terraform apply -auto-approve


```
- Please see the sections below for full details.

1- Variable Sets
===
Variable sets are a group of commonly used variables that you can apply to multiple workspaces in an organization.

- In our application deployment, the Terraform provider for Google Cloud uses four environment variables:

  - The Google Cloud Client ID,
  - a corresponding Google Cloud Client Secret,
  - an Google Cloud Organization Subscrition ID, and
  - an Google Cloud account Tenant ID

- Assume that these keys are sensitive and need to be protected. You can show the variable names and the values you need to set them to by running this in the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab:

```bash
echo "" && \
echo "GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS = $GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS" && \
echo "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID = $INSTRUQT_GCP_PROJECT_GCPPROJECT_PROJECT_ID"


```

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab and expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>terraform-cloud</t> folder. Observe the updates to the file <t><img src="../assets/tf-icon.png"/>main.tf</t>

- Note the update to configure a Variable Set named Cloud Crendentials (lines 51-95). These variables are sensitive and reflect a dedicated Google Cloud Service Principal to support infrastructure deployments.

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Settings</x>-<x>Variable sets</x>. Please see the example image below.

![Variable Sets](../assets/variable_sets.png)

- Explore the Variable Set and figure out how it links to your `[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]` workspace.

---

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Projects & workspaces</x>-<x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x>-<x>Variables</x>-<x>Variable Sets</x> Please see the example image below.

![Variable Sets Linked in Workspace](../assets/variable_sets_link.png)

- Note that Global variables are immutable at the `[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]` workspace level. You need administrative control of the variable set to make changes.

2- Workspace Variables
===
Workspace variables always overwrite variables from variable sets that have the same type and the same key.

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab and expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>terraform-cloud</t> folder. Observe the updates to the file <t><img src="../assets/tf-icon.png"/>main.tf</t>

- The application uses two Terraform variables, `region` and `prefix`. We configure these workspace-specific variables (lines 96-119). These are _not_ sensitive and relate to the properties that you can define in your TERRAFORM code for deployment.

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Projects & workspaces</x>-<x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x>-<x>Variables</x>-<x>Workspace Variables</x>. Please see the example image below.

![Workspace Variables](../assets/workspace_variables.png)

3- Test Remote Execution
===
Your <x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x> workspace is updated to **Remote Execution** mode. This means plans and applies occur on Terraform Cloud's infrastructure. You and your team have the ability to review and collaborate on runs within the app.

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab and expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>terraform-cloud</t> folder. Observe the updates to the file <t><img src="../assets/tf-icon.png"/>main.tf</t> in lines 38-50.

- Test your application deployment with REMOTE execution. In the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab, perform an update to your <x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x> workspace.

```bash
cd /root/hashicat-gcp

# Use local apply command option to trigger
# a remote run in Terraform Cloud
terraform apply -auto-approve


```

- The `terraform apply` command triggers your plans and applies to occur on Terraform Cloud's infrastructure.

- To examine the results, on the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Projects & workspaces</x>-<x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x>-<x>Overview</x>. Please see the example image below.

Congratulations, you have accomplished a number of things:

1. The Google Cloud Service Principal keys are now safely encrypted and stored in an organization-wide Variable Set.

2. Your deployment properties are configured with your workspace-specific variables.

3. Terraform Cloud manages your application deployments and you can trigger work remotely.

Report back to William with the <v>Check</v> button below once you've successfully deployed the hashicat application via Terraform Cloud.
