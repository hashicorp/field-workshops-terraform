title: Controlling Costs with Cost Estimation
teaser: |
  Developers in your organization are running large VMs that are costing a lot of money. You need a way to restrict the costs of each workspace.

    Developers often run bigger VMs than are really necessary. Karen from
    finance pays you a visit to see if you can help:

    > Hello sysadmin, we got a really big Google Cloud bill last month. Finance would like to
    inform developers using Terraform Cloud about estimated monthly costs of their
    Cloud resources before they deploy. Can we do that?

    You can learn more about Terraform Cloud's Cost Estimation feature with these links:

      * https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/cost-estimation/index.html

    Note that Sentinel can be used to prevent runs from being applied if estimated monthly costs or their increases are too high.

    See the following example Sentinel policies:
      * [Limit proposed monthly costs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-proposed-monthly-cost.sentinel)
      * [Limit costa by workspace](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-cost-by-workspace-name.sentinel)
      * [Limit costs and percentage increase](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-cost-and-percentage-increase.sentinel)

In this challenge you are setting up [Cost Estimation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/cost-estimation/index.html). Terraform Cloud provides cost estimates for many resources found in your Terraform configuration.

- For each resource an hourly and monthly cost is shown, along with the monthly delta.

- The total cost and delta of all estimable resources is also shown.

1- Enable Cost Estimation
===
Enabling Cost Estimation across all workspaces of an organization in Terraform Cloud is very easy.

- The Team & Governance plan enables cost estimation by default. You can enable or disable the feature in your organization's settings.

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Settings</x>-<x>Cost Estimation</x> and check the <x>Enable Cost Estimation for all workspaces</x> box. Please see the example image below.

![Organization Cost Estimation](../assets/org_cost_estimation.png)

- **Note**: In Terraform Enterprise, you need to provide Cloud credentials for the platform for which you want cost estimates. See this [link](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/admin/integration.html#cost-estimation-integration).

2- Test Cost Estimation
===
When enabled, Terraform Cloud performs a cost estimate for every run. Estimated costs appear in the run UI as an extra run phase, between the plan and apply.

- To see a cost estimate for your hashicat-gcp workspace, trigger a new run.

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Projects & workspaces</x>-<x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_WORKSPACE" hostname="workstation" ]]</x>, choose <x>Actions</x> and <x>Start new run</x>. Please see the example image below.

![Workspace New Run](../assets/workspace_new_run.png)

- You will then see the estimated monthly cost of the workspace which is based on the costs of the Google Cloud resources provisioned for the hashicat-gcp workspace. Please see the example image below.

A complete list of Google Cloud resources for which cost estimates are available in Terraform Cloud is [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/cost-estimation/gcp).

---
Outstanding work! The team can see cost estimates before implementation. You can add to your notes the following:

- Everyone involved can have cost visibility.

- Cost estimates are available for multiple Cloud platforms.
