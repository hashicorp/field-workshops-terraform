title: Sentinel CLI Basics
teaser: Learn how to use the Sentinel CLI.
description: |-
  [Sentinel](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel) allows customers to implement policy-as-code in the same way that Terraform implements infrastructure-as-code.

  Governance and security teams can write Sentinel policies to restrict what can be done in HashiCorp's Enterprise products.

  In this track, you will learn how to use the Sentinel CLI.

  After doing this track, you can learn how to write and test Sentinel policies for Terraform in the [Sentinel for Terraform (v2)](https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/sentinel-for-terraform-v2) track.

  title: The Sentinel CLI
  teaser: Learn about the Sentinel CLI commands.
  assignment: |-
    The Sentinel Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to apply and test Sentinel policies including those that use mocks generated from Terraform Cloud plans.

    Let's start with some basic Sentinel commands, running them in the "Sentinel CLI" tab on the left.

    Check the version of Sentinel running on your machine:
    ```
    sentinel version
    ```

    See the list of Sentinel CLI commands:
    ```
    sentinel
    ```

    Get help for the "sentinel apply" command:
    ```
    sentinel apply -h
    ```
    Please read the output to learn about the "apply" command.

    Note that you can also use the "-help" and "--help" flags instead of "-h".

    Get help for the "sentinel test" command:
    ```
    sentinel test -h
    ```
    Please read the output to learn about the "test" command.

    The "sentinel apply" and "sentinel test" commands both evaluate a Sentinel policy, but the latter tests it against multiple test case files.

      We've launched the Sentinel CLI 0.15.6 on a Ubuntu VM running in GCP so that you don't need to download or install it.

      After learning how to use the Sentinel CLI in the first challenge, you will run a very simple policy in the second challenge.

  title: Run Your First Sentinel Policy
  teaser: Apply and test your first Sentinel policy.
  assignment: |-
    ## Apply the Policy
    Now that you are familiar with the Sentinel CLI commands, let's apply and test your first Sentinel policy.

    Take a look at the "require-even-number.sentinel" policy on the "First Policy" tab. This checks that a parameter called "the_number" is an even integer; it's default value is 1.

    Apply the "require-even-number.sentinel" policy with the default value of 1 on the "Sentinel CLI" tab:
    ```
    sentinel apply require-even-number.sentinel
    ```
    This will fail since 1 is an odd number.

    Apply the "require-even-number.sentinel" policy with a value of 2:
    ```
    sentinel apply -param the_number=2 require-even-number.sentinel
    ```
    This will pass since 2 is an even number.

    Run that command again, but add `-trace` before the name of the policy to make Sentinel print more information:
    ```
    sentinel apply -param the_number=2 -trace require-even-number.sentinel
    ```
    Note that adding `-trace` causes the `sentinel test` command to print output from any of the policy's `print` statements even when a test case passes.

    ## Test the Policy
    Now, we will test the policy with the "sentinel test" command using test cases. For any policy, the test cases must be placed under the directory test/<policy\> under the directory containing the policy where <policy\> is the name of the policy without the ".sentinel" extension.

    Edit the "fail.json" test case for the "require-even-number.sentinel" policy on the "Test Cases" tab, replacing `<an_odd_number>` with any odd number.  Save the "fail.json" file by clicking the disk icon above the file.

    Edit the "pass.json" test case for the "require-even-number.sentinel" policy on the "Test Cases" tab, replacing `<an_even_number>` with any even number. Save the "pass.json" file by clicking the disk icon above the file.

    Test the "require-even-number.sentinel" policy against both test cases on the "Sentinel CLI" tab:
    ```
    sentinel test -run=number -verbose
    ```
    Both test cases should pass and show you the numbers that were used.

    Note that when specifying a policy with the "-run" argument, you can match any portion of the policy name. Often, you will want to use something that only matches a single policy in the current directory.

    Congratulations on completing the track. That way easy!
