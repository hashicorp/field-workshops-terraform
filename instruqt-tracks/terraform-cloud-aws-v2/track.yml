title: Terraform Cloud with AWS
teaser: |
  Terraform Cloud enables infrastructure automation for provisioning, compliance, and management of any cloud, data center, and service.
description: |-
  Work with the devops team at ACME as they go from manual provisioning with Terraform to a fully automated devops workflow with code reviews, testing, and automated provisioning in AWS Cloud.

  <br>

  1. **Run infrastructure as code remotely**: Store state and execute Terraform runs in an SOC2 compliant and reliable environment.

  2. **Establish Cloud compliance and management**: Set up permissions and governance features across any resource managed by Terraform. Add capabilities for policy enforcement.

  3. **Create self-service infrastructure with a private registry**: Standardize infrastructure across your provisioning processes using your own private registry.
