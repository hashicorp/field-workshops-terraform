title: Terraform Compliance with Sentinel
teaser: |
  Developers in your organization are building cloud resources without tagging them properly. Use Sentinel to enforce tagging on all your AWS instances that are built with Terraform.
notes:

  contents: |-
    Developers love working in the cloud but do not have guidance on spending limits. Finance has a large AWS bill from last month and they want to bill-back to each project.

    Karen from finance asks for help:

    > Hello sysadmin, is it possible ensure that each deployment stays within a spending threshold?
    > And, for bill-back enablement, can we make sure all projects are properly tagged so we can track departments and environments that use Cloud resources?

In this challenge we use HashiCorp Sentinel policies to enforce two rules:

1. A rule that requires any AWS instance created in your account to have  identifying tags for `Environment` and `Department`.

2. A rule to ensure that costs are maintained below an estimation of $100 USD prior to deployment.

To get started, use the <t><img src="../assets/shell.png"/>Terminal</t> tab to create a new Policy Set and assign it to the hashicat-aws workspace with the following:

```bash
cd /root/terraform-cloud

# 1. Create a policy set from VCS.
# 2. Enable automated policy as code
# 3. Apply to hashicat-aws workspace
terraform apply -auto-approve


```

1- Sentinel Policies
===

Sentinel policies define rules that restrict the provisioning of resources by Terraform configurations.

Terraform enforces Sentinel policies between the plan and apply phases of a run, preventing out of policy infrastructure from being provisioned.

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab to expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>hashicat-aws</t> folder, and browse the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>policies</t> folder.

- Open the <t><img src="../assets/file-icon.png"/>enforce-mandatory-tags.sentinel</t> file and read the structure of the Sentinel language. This rule checks for configuration properties in the Terraform plan prior to the "apply" stage.

- Open the <t><img src="../assets/file-icon.png"/>restrict-deployment-cost.sentinel</t> file and examine the rule syntax as it supports a logical check on the cost estimation.

For a comprehensive collection of Sentinel Policies, please visit this [HashiCorp Repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies) and explore possible applications across multiple platforms.

2- Policy Sets
===
In our environment, Terraform Cloud looks at your GitHub repo that contains the Sentinel Policy Sets to use in your own organization.

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab and expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>terraform-cloud</t> folder.

- Note the changes to the file <t><img src="../assets/tf-icon.png"/>main.tf</t> which automatically configures a Policy Set and links it to the hashicat-aws workspace (lines 300-319).

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>[[ Instruqt-Var key="TF_ORG" hostname="workstation" ]]</x>-<x>Settings</x>-<x>Policy Sets</x> and explore the <x>Hashicat-Social</x> policy set.

![Organization Policy Set](../assets/org_policy_sets.png)

- To view the results of this new configuration, issue a manual run in the Terraform Cloud UI.

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Workspaces</x>-<x>hashicat-aws</x>, choose <x>Actions</x> and <x>Start new run</x>. Please see the example image below.

![Workspace New Run](../assets/workspace_new_run.png)

- On the Terraform Cloud portal, navigate to <x>Workspaces</x>-<x>hashicat-aws</x>-<x>Runs</x> and, on the <x>Current Run</x> note the application of the policies AFTER the plan, but BEFORE the apply phase. Please see the example image below.

![Workspace Policy Checks](../assets/workspace_policy_checks.png)

- Use the <m>Override & Continue</m> button, and then <m>Override Policy Check</m> to complete the sequence.

---

- Use the <t><img src="../assets/web.png"/>Code Editor</t> tab to expand the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>hashicat-aws</t> folder, and browse the <t><img src="../assets/folder.png"/>policies</t> folder.

- Read the <t><img src="../assets/hcl-icon.png"/>sentinel.hcl</t> file. This file is used to direct Terraform Cloud how to apply these policies.

- Notice that the policies are set to **soft-mandatory** - which implies that failed policies stop the run, and someone with authority can override a failed policy check during a run. Other possible values are:

  - **hard-mandatory** - Failed policies stop the run.
  - **advisory** - Failed policies produce a warning.

Wow, Sysadmin! Please let Karen, Lars, Hiro and Jane know that:

1. We can use Policy as Code with Sentinel and OPA to enforce business rules, technical rules, and security guidelines.

2. We have implemented rules to ensure each deployment is identified by its Cloud tagging for internal billing purposes.

3. The rules also include a cost control policy to ensure uses do not exceed a specific spending threshold.

4. Emphasize that each time you push a change to your Terraform code, you trigger a new run - which include policy checks.

Use the <v>Check</v> button below to share this important news.
