title: $ Controlling Costs with Cost Estimation
teaser: |
  Developers in your organization are running large VMs that are costing a lot of money. You need a way to restrict the costs of each workspace.

    Hello sysadmin, we got a really big GCP bill last month and would like you to
    inform developers using Terraform Cloud about estimated monthly costs of their
    workspaces before they apply runs. Can you do that?"

    Note that Sentinel can be used to prevent runs from being applied if estimated monthly costs or their increases are too high.

    See the following example Sentinel policies:
      * [limit-proposed-monthly-cost.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-proposed-monthly-cost.sentinel)
      * [limit-cost-by-workspace-name.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-cost-by-workspace-name.sentinel)
      * [limit-cost-and-percentage-increase.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-cost-and-percentage-increase.sentinel)

In this challenge you'll use Terraform Cloud's [Cost Estimation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/cost-estimation/index.html) feature to inform developers what the estimated monthly costs of their hashicat-gcp workspace will be.

Enabling Cost Estimation across all workspaces of an organization in Terraform Cloud is very easy. All you need to do is visit the "Settings | Cost estimation" page of your organization and check the "Enable Cost Estimation for all workspaces" checkbox.

Note that in Terraform Enterprise, you also need to provide cloud credentials for the clouds for which you want cost estimates. See this [link](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/admin/integration.html#cost-estimation-integration).

To see a cost estimate for your hashicat-gcp workspace, just trigger a new run in it by clicking the `Actions` drop-down and then selecting "Start a new plan". You will then see the estimated monthly cost of the workspace which is based on the costs of the `google_compute_instance` resource provisioned for the hashicat-gcp workspace.

A complete list of GCP resources for which cost estimates are available in Terraform Cloud is [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/cost-estimation/gcp.html).

Finally, note that Sentinel's [tfrun](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/import/tfrun.html) import can be used to prevent runs from being applied when workspaces would incur excessive monthly costs or cost increases.

See the following example Sentinel policies:
  * [limit-proposed-monthly-cost.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-proposed-monthly-cost.sentinel)
  * [limit-cost-by-workspace-name.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-cost-by-workspace-name.sentinel)
  * [limit-cost-and-percentage-increase.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/limit-cost-and-percentage-increase.sentinel)
