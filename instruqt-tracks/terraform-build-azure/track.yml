  assignment: |-
    Let's start with some basic terraform commands.
    Run the following commands in the terminal on the left.
    Check the version of Terraform running on your machine:
    ```
    terraform version
    ```
    You can always get help if you're curious about command syntax:
    ```
    terraform help
    ```
    Terraform runs on Windows, OSX, or Linux. You can install it on your laptop or on a cloud based workstation. Terraform is also pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell.
    Today we'll be using the preconfigured terraform workstation on the left for all our lab exercises.

  teaser: Safely connect to the Azure APIs using a service principal.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform needs credentials to be able to connect to Azure and build resources.
    We've pre-installed some temporary credentials in your Instruqt training environment. These credentials are stored as environment variables. You should never store sensitive API keys inside your source code.
    Terraform can automatically read and use the environment variables that are in your shell environment.
    Run the following command to see your temporary credentials:
    ```
    env | grep ARM_CLIENT
    ```
    *Do not ever store your credentials in source code files*, as they can be accidentally exposed or copied to a public repository.

  assignment: |-
    We've downloaded some terraform code onto your workstation. Run the following command to see the terraform code files:
    ```
    ls *.tf
    ```
    The same files are visible in the file explorer pane on the left. Terraform files are marked with the purple T icon.
    Terraform code always ends with a `.tf` extension. You can have as many terraform files as you want, but these three are commonly created first:
    **main.tf** - Where most of your terraform code is stored. This is the part that does the building of resources.
    **variables.tf** - Use this file to define which variables will be available to your users.
    **outputs.tf** - This file contains outputs that will be shown at the end of a successful terraform run.
    Files that end in anything other than `*.tf` or `*.tfvars` are ignored by Terraform.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform will read anything in the current directory that ends in `*.tf` or `*.tfvars`.
      By convention most terraform workspaces will contain `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files.
      You can also group your terraform code into files by purpose. For example, you might place all your load balancer configuration code into a file called `load_balancer.tf`.

  title: ☁️ Terraform Init - Install the Azure Provider
  teaser: Terraform needs a provider to talk to cloud APIs. The provider is the bridge
    that connects terraform core to your infrastructure providers.
  assignment: |-
    We have downloaded some terraform code for the HashiCat application. We'll be using this source code for the rest of the track.
    Before we can do anything with terraform we need to initialize our workspace. Run the following    command in your terminal window:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
    The *terraform init* command scans your terraform code, identifies any providers that are needed,    and downloads them.
    Run the following command to take a peek inside the `.terraform` directory:
    ```
    ls .terraform/plugins/linux_amd64/
    ```
    This hidden directory is where all modules and plugins are stored.
  notes:

      Today we'll be using the *azurerm* provider. AzureRM stands for Azure Resource Manager.

    your Terraform code is valid and parses correctly.
  assignment: |-
    Terraform comes with a built-in subcommand called *validate*. This is useful when you want to do a quick syntax check of your code to make sure it parses correctly.
    Click on the File Explorer icon on the left if it is not already open. It looks like a stack of papers.
    Edit the main.tf file and remove the curly brace on line 4 of the file.
    Validate your code:
    ```
    terraform validate
    ```
    Now put the curly brace back onto line 4 and run the validate command again. This time you should pass the validation test.
    **terraform validate** is most often used in automated CI/CD test pipelines. It allows you to quickly catch errors in your code before any other steps are taken.

    view the output.
  assignment: |-
    Run the **terraform plan** command:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
    When you run this command terraform will prompt you to enter the `prefix` variable.
    Enter a short string of lower-case letters and/or numbers. You can use your own name here if you wish.
    **Keep your prefix string all lower case, and between 5-12 characters long. Do not use an underscore in your prefix.**
    The prefix will become part of your application hostname, and therefore must be DNS-compliant. Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7) letters from a to z, the digits from 0 to 9, and the hyphen (-).  A hostname may not start with a hyphen.

    any code. You can use the same terraform code to deploy dev, staging and production
    but with different variables.
  assignment: |-
    We've created a **terraform.tfvars** file for you to edit. This is a special file where you can set any variables you wish to change from their defaults.
    Variables are *defined* in the **variables.tf** file. They are *set* in the **terraform.tfvars** file.
    In terraform all variables must be declared (with or without an optional default value) before you can use them.
    Open the **terraform.tfvars** file and set your prefix variable there. Save the file.
    Now run `terraform plan` again. This time you won't have to enter your prefix manually.

  assignment: |-
    In one of the previous challenges we set our *prefix* variable.
    Choose the Azure location nearest to you and set the location variable in your **terraform.tfvars** file. You may need to close and re-open the file if it appears blank.
    You can find a list of valid Azure locations here:

    that terraform might make. When you run terraform apply these changes are implemented,
    and terraform builds, updates, or destroys resources.
  assignment: |-
    Now that we've configured our required variables we can apply our changes.

    Run the *terraform plan* command first to see what will happen:

    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
    Confirm the proper prefix and location are displayed in the plan output.

    Then run *terraform apply* and watch your resource group being built.

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    You'll need to enter *yes* when terraform prompts you with the "Do you want to perform these actions?" question.

    Right now our code only defines a single Azure resource group. We'll be building upon this starting point in the next challenge.

    This is normal and expected.

    Now try running another apply:

    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    Terraform checks each resource to ensure it is in the proper state. It will not re-create your resource group if it is already provisioned correctly.

  teaser: Terraform works great with many different provisioning tools including Chef,
    Puppet, Ansible, Bash, and Powershell.
  assignment: |-
    Open the `main.tf` file in the Code Editor. Scroll down to line 157 where you will see the remote-exec provisioner block.

    Add the following at the end of the inline list of commands:

    ```
    "sudo apt -y install cowsay",
    "cowsay Mooooooooooo!",
    ```

    Now run another *terraform apply* to apply your changes:

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Scroll back through the log output. You should see an ASCII art cow saying "Moooooooo!"
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: Terraform provisioners run once at creation time. They do not run on
      subsequent applies, except in special circumstances. (Like this training lab...)
  - type: text
    contents: We've made some special adjustments to force the provisioner run every
      time you type terraform apply. This is so you can practice playing with provisioners
      without destroying and recreating your virtual machine every time you make a
      change.

    URLs or other useful data.
  assignment: |-
    Open the **outputs.tf** file in the Code Editor.

    Add a second output for the `ip_address` of your web server.

    Name your output `catapp_ip`.

    You may refer to the docs page to see what types of outputs are valid:

    [Terraform Azure Docs - Click Here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/public_ip.html)
    [Terraform Outputs Docs - Click Here] (https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html)

    Run the terraform refresh command to view your new output:

    ```
    terraform refresh
    ```

    You can run the terraform output command to view all your outputs:

    ```
    terraform output
    ```

  title: "\U0001F436 Fun With Variables"
  teaser: Variables give the consumers of your terraform code an easy way to customize
    their infrastructure.
  assignment: |-
    There are several ways to configure Terraform variables. So far we've been using the **terraform.tfvars** file to set our variables. Try re-deploying your application with different **height** and **width** variables on the command line. Reload the webapp after each apply to observe any changes.

    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var height=600 -var width=800
    ```

    Next try setting an environment variable that Terraform can read. Run this command to set the placeholder variable:

    ```
    export TF_VAR_placeholder=placedog.net
    ```

    Run another *terraform apply* command:
    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Now try it again with the same variable set differently on the command line:
    ```
    terraform apply -auto-approve -var placeholder=placebear.com
    ```

    Which variable took precedence? Why?
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Terraform variables have five levels of precedence. 1=highest 5=lowest:

      1. Command line flag - run as a command line switch
      1. Configuration file - set in your terraform.tfvars file
      1. Environment variable - part of your shell environment
      1. Default Config - default value in variables.tf
      1. User manual entry - if not specified, prompt the user for entry
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Here are some other fun placeholder sites you can try with the *placeholder* variable:

      placedog.net<br>
      placebear.com<br>

  title: ☁️ Terraform Cloud Setup
  teaser: Terraform Cloud offers unlimited free terraform state storage for users.
    Safeguard your state files by storing them remotely in Terraform Cloud.
  assignment: |-
    Sign up for a free Terraform Cloud account at the following URL:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Once you're signed into Terraform Cloud create a new organization called YOURNAME-sandbox. Replace YOURNAME with your own name or other text.

    Next you'll be prompted to create a workspace. You can skip the VCS integration step by clicking the "No VCS Connection" button. Name your workspace **hashicat**.

    Now go into the workspace's **Settings >> General** settings page and change the Execution Mode to local.  Be sure to save your settings! This will allow us to run terraform commands from our workstation with local variables.

  teaser: The terraform command line tool can store its state in Terraform Cloud.
    All that is required is a user token.
  assignment: |-
    In the Terraform Cloud web UI, go into your Terraform Cloud User Settings by clicking the icon in the upper right corner. Under User Settings click on Tokens. Generate a new token for your workstation. You can call it **workshop-token**.

    Open the `/root/.terraformrc` file with the "File > Open File" menu command. Replace where it says YOURTOKENHERE with the user token you just created. Save and close the file.

    Edit the `remote_backend.tf` file. Replace the organization with your sandbox organization name. Replace the workspace name with **hashicat**. Save the file.

    Now run a *terraform init* to migrate your state to Terraform Cloud:

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    Type "yes" when it prompts you to migrate your state into Terraform Cloud.

    Your state is now safely stored in Terraform Cloud.

    Run another `terraform apply` and watch your state file evolve with each change. You can browse through previous state files with the Terraform Cloud UI.
  notes:

    contents: |-
      With *local* execution mode the terraform commands and variables all remain
      on your workstation.

      With *remote* execution mode terraform runs in a Terraform Cloud
      container environment. All variables must be configured in the cloud environment with this method.

    using it. This helps control costs and reduce infrastructure sprawl.
  assignment: |-
    Run the following command to destroy your infrastructure:

    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```

    You'll need to type "yes" when prompted to destroy your infrastructure. This is a safety feature to help prevent accidental deletion of important resources.

    Wait until the destroy action has completely finished before clicking on the *Check* button.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: Terraform can destroy infrastructure as easily as it can build it. Use
      terraform with caution.
